Most recently, the online retail behemoth announced a refresh was on hand for <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/01/amazon-cloud-drive-photos-android-app/">Cloud Drive Photos</a> on Android, providing users of said app with an auto-save option that, as you likely guessed, allows pics to be automatically uploaded to ones cloud account -- this, according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a>, was "the most requested feature from our customers." Better yet, version 1.2 also brings camera integration to devices running <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/android+4.0.4/">Android 4.0.4</a> or later, which will make it easier for some folks to quickly snap a shot and save it to the cloud-based drive without too much effort. Other tidbits like multiple file downloads and uploads made it to this release as well, making for a pretty plentiful update overall -- links to download from Google Play or Amazon's own app store can be found down below.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/software/" rel="tag">Software</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/amazon/" rel="tag">Amazon</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/25/amazon-cloud-drive-photos-android-update/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.clouddrive.photos&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a><!--//-->, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A11AN6O/ref=cd_android_appstore2">Amazon</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"cfc682f3affdb3012fe63d7e6bf8be1c";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:31:"Olympikus Mobile Apps + Website";s:4:"link";s:68:"http://www.behance.net/gallery/Olympikus-Mobile-Apps-Website/6627915";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:4:"date";i:1359104401;s:7:"content";s:482:"<img src="http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles/59997/projects/6627915/e08202833d093280aad697ce1251d6df.jpg"><br> Working along with DON Agency on the expansion of the digital image for Olympus Argentina.

At 2Tbps, the Chinese company's field test -- one it's hailing as a "world's first" -- comes nowhere close to the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/01/researchers-create-two-100-terabit-per-second-optical-connection/">100Tbps-plus experiments</a> conducted by the likes of NEC and NICT. But top speed isn't entirely the point here; real-world performance is. By leveraging existing fiber infrastructure owned by <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Vodafone/">Vodafone</a> across portions of lower Germany, Huawei was able to successfully demonstrate two record-breaking, 200G transmissions: one spanning 1,500km and the other 3,325km over an "ultra-long-haul solution." To give you a bit of perspective on just what sort of data haul theoretical networks of this kind can achieve, Huawei claims this ultra-fast connection is "equivalent to downloading 40 HD videos in once second." Impressive, indeed. But don't go ditching that TWC wideband or FiOS contract just yet. While it's nice to know this tech exists, practical deployment is still a ways off. Until then, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/googlefiber/">gigabit's</a> the buzz word.</p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <strong>Huawei and Vodafone Complete World's First 2 Tbit/s WDM Field Trial</strong></p>  <p>   <br>   Shenzhen, China, 24 January 2013:</p>  <p>   Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology solutions provider, and Vodafone, one of the world's largest mobile communications companies, today announced the successful trial of 2 Tbit/s optical fiber transmission technologies on Vodafone's live network. The field trial achieved 2 Tbit/s transmission capabilities of over 3,325km. This provides a data highway capacity 20-times higher than current commercially deployed 100Gbit/s systems and has a speed equivalent to downloading 40 HD videos in one second. This marks an important step forward for optical transport technology advances beyond 100G.</p>  <p>   <br>   Traffic on carrier backbone networks is growing exponentially, driving global momentum for commercial 100G deployments and attracting attention on optical transport beyond 100G. Riding on cutting-edge technologies such as flex oDSP, super SD-FEC, and flex modulation format, this field trial achieved a record-breaking transmission distance of 1,500 km using a super-channel PDM-16QAM-based high spectral efficiency solution, and a second record-breaking transmission distance of 3,325 km using a super-channel Nyquist PDM-QPSK-based ultra-long-haul solution. Both transmissions were on a link with G.652 fibers and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) without electrical regeneration. The link used in the trial was on Vodafone's backbone network, passing through a few cities across middle and south Germany.</p>  <p>   <br>   "We are at the forefront of global 100G deployments, and have taken the lead in delivering key breakthroughs in technologies beyond 100G. Through collaboration with Vodafone and other leading international operators and customer-centric R&amp;D, Huawei is always ready to build advanced optical networks for customers," said Jack Wang, president of Huawei's transport network product line.</p>  <p>   <br>   To help customers optimize their overall technical architecture and adopt next-generation transport networks, Huawei conducted the world's first 2T WDM field trial and pan- European 400G field trial in 2012, and also unveiled a series of scientific research achievements in optical transmission. According to Ovum, Huawei ranks No. 1 in the WDM/OTN, 40G, 100G, and global optical network markets, as of Q3 2012.</p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/" rel="tag">Internet</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/25/huawei-2tbps-data-transmission-vodafone-germany/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"6c648f30a38cf485d9f8aad45afd3171";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:47:"Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters: Film Review";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/CQq16_nvLhE/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:14:"Stephen Farber";s:4:"date";i:1359102043;s:7:"content";s:2532:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2012/10/hansel_and_gretel_witch_hunters_a_l.jpg"><br>Campy, violent version of Grimm's fairy tale should entice fanboys.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hansel-gretel-witch-hunters/review/415312" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27e1fc64/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Hansel+%26+Gretel%3A+Witch+Hunters%3A+Film+Review&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fmovie%2Fhansel-gretel-witch-hunters%2Freview%2F415312" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Hansel+%26+Gretel%3A+Witch+Hunters%3A+Film+Review&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fmovie%2Fhansel-gretel-witch-hunters%2Freview%2F415312" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/UniversityofMichigan/">University of Michigan</a> has developed a technique involving liquid metal that could shed most of the heat -- and cost. By coating a liquid gallium electrode with silicon tetrachloride, researchers can generate pure silicon crystals through the gallium's electrons at a comparatively cool 180F.

Samsung, Nokia and Apple, in that order, were the biggest movers of handsets, though the latter two change places when it comes to smartphones -- <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/nokia/">Espoo</a> only shipped 35 million to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/">Cupertino's</a> 135, while Samsung topped the trio at 213 million devices shipped.</p><p> Surprising?

The numbers <em>are</em> telling though -- according to ABI Research, Apple saw less growth in 2012 than the previous year, and may hit a plateau in market share in 2013. Samsung, on the other hand, may have some room to grow -- capturing 34 percent of total smartphone shipments in Q4 with over 60 million smartphones moved. Apple nabbed 24.5% of the market with 47.8 million shipped iPhones, while Nokia and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/RIM/">RIM</a> took up the tail of the quarter with 86.3 and 6.9 million shipped devices, respectively.

Samsung was the star performer, accounting for 1 in 4 of all mobile phones shipped worldwide last year.</p>  <p>   Neil Shah, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, "Ongoing macroeconomic challenges in mature markets like North America and Western Europe, tighter operator upgrade policies, and shifting consumer tastes were among the key reasons why global mobile phone shipments grew just 2 percent annually to reach 1.6 billion units in 2012. Fuelled by robust demand for its popular Galaxy models, Samsung was the star performer, shipping a record 396.5 million mobile phones worldwide and capturing 25 percent marketshare to solidify its first-place lead. However, Samsung's total volumes for the year fell just short of the 400-million threshold."</p>  <p>   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, "Nokia's global mobile phone shipments fell 20 percent from 417.1 million units in 2011 to 335.6 million in 2012. Nokia faced tough competition from Samsung in developing markets like China, while Apple and others ramped up the pressure in developed regions such as Western Europe. Nokia's dual-SIM feature phones, Asha touchphones and Lumia handsets have been performing well, but this was not enough to offset a slump in demand for the company's aging Symbian smartphone platform last year."</p>  <p>   Linda Sui, Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, "Apple shipped a record 135.8 million mobile phones worldwide in 2012. Apple delivered 46 percent annual growth last year, which was bolstered by solid demand in North America and Asia. Apple's launch of the iPhone 5 in Q4 2012 was a success as volumes ramped up in dozens of countries worldwide, but negative media coverage of the model's new integrated maps service and supply chain challenges cast a slight shadow over the launch."</p>  <p>   Other findings from the research include:<br>   o. ZTE captured 5 percent share of the global mobile phone market in 2012, as its shipments fell minus 8 percent from 2011, partly because of heightened competition in core markets like China and Western Europe from rivals such as Coolpad and Samsung.</p>  <table cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="16">      <p>       Exhibit 1: Global Mobile Phone Vendor Shipments and Market Share in Q4 2012

Samsung was the star performer, capturing 30 percent marketshare worldwide and extending its lead over Apple and Nokia.</p>  <p>   Neil Shah, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, "Global smartphone shipments grew 38 percent annually from 157.0 million units in Q4 2011 to 217.0 million in Q4 2012. Global smartphone shipments for the full year reached a record 700.1 million units in 2012, increasing robustly from 490.5 million units in 2011. Global shipment growth slowed from 64 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2012 as penetration of smartphones began to mature in developed regions such as North America and Western Europe."</p>  <p>   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, "Samsung shipped a record 213.0 million smartphones worldwide and captured 30 percent marketshare in 2012. This was the largest number of units ever shipped by a smartphone vendor in a single year, beating Nokia's previous all-time record when it shipped 100.1 million units during 2010. Despite tough competition in stores and courtrooms, Samsung continued to deliver numerous hit models, from the high-end Galaxy Note2 phablet to the mass-market Galaxy Y. Apple grew a healthy 46 percent annually and shipped 135.8 million smartphones worldwide for 19 percent marketshare in 2012, broadly flat from the 19 percent level recorded in 2011. Apple had a strong year in developed regions like North America, but this was offset partly by its limited presence in high-growth emerging markets such as Africa."</p>  <p>   Linda Sui, Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, "Samsung and Apple together accounted for half of all smartphones shipped worldwide in 2012. Large marketing budgets, extensive distribution channels and attractive product portfolios have enabled Samsung and Apple to tighten their grip on the smartphone industry. The growth of Samsung and Apple has continued to impact Nokia. Nokia retained its position as the world's third largest smartphone vendor for full-year 2012, but its global marketshare has dropped sharply from 16 percent to five percent during the past year. Nokia's Windows Phone portfolio has improved significantly in recent months, with new models like the Lumia 920, but we believe the vendor still lacks a true hero model in its range that can be considered an Apple iPhone or Samsung S3 killer."</p>  <p>   Exhibit 1: Global Smartphone Vendor Shipments and Market Share in Q4 2012 <sup>1</sup></p>  <table cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>      Global Smartphone Vendor Shipments (Millions of Units)</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      Q4 '11</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      2011</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      Q4 '12</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      2012</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Samsung</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      36.5</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      97.4</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      63.0</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      213.0</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Apple</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      37.0</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      93.0</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      47.8</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      135.8</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Nokia</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      19.6</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      77.3</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      6.6</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      35.0</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Others</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      63.9</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      222.8</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      99.6</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      316.3</td>    </tr><tr><td>      <p>       Total</p>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      157.0</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      490.5</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      217.0</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      700.1</td>    </tr><tr><td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>    </tr><tr><td>      Global Smartphone Vendor Marketshare %</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      Q4 '11</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      2011</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      Q4 '12</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      2012</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Samsung</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      23.2%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      19.9%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      29.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      30.4%</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Apple</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      23.6%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      19.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      22.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      19.4%</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Nokia</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      12.5%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      15.8%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      3.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      5.0%</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Others</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      40.7%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      45.4%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      45.9%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      45.2%</td>    </tr><tr><td>      Total</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      100.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      100.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      100.0%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      100.0%</td>    </tr><tr><td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>    </tr><tr><td>      Total Growth Year-over-Year %</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      55.9%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      63.8%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      38.2%</td>     <td>     </td>     <td>      42.7%</td>    </tr></tbody></table><br><p>   <br><strong>Smartphone Pressure Mounts for Samsung and Apple Exiting a Strong Q4 2012, According to ABI Research</strong></p>  <p>   SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nearly 196 million smartphones and 451 million handsets were shipped during Q4 2012, according to the latest estimates from marketing intelligence firm ABI Research. This brings 2012 annual totals to 653 million smartphone and 1.6 billion handset shipments, representing a 36% and 2% YoY growth rate respectively. Smartphones accounted for 43% of all handset shipments in Q4, which pushed smartphones to 41% of all shipments in 2012.</p>  <p>   Samsung retained its lead position overall by shipping 106 million handsets of which 60 million were smartphones in Q4 and capturing 31% of total smartphone shipments. In 2012 Samsung grew its handset shipments by 21.6% and its smartphone shipments by 123.8%. Despite missing most analyst estimates in Q4, Apple grew its smartphone shipment share to 24.5%, up from 16.4% in Q3. Apple shipped 47.8 million iPhones in Q4 bringing its 2012 annual total to 135.8 million. Apple's 2012 annual shipment growth declined from 96% in 2011 to 46% in 2012.</p>  <p>   "It is clear that the iPhone's hyper-growth has ended, and ABI Research believes that Apple's market share will peak in 2013 at 22%," says mobile devices senior analyst Michael Morgan. "Unless Apple is willing to trade iPhone margins for low cost iPhone shipments, Apple's handset market share will become dependent on customer loyalty."</p>  <p>   Looking at the rest of the pack, Nokia shipped 86.3 million handsets and 6.6 million smartphones in Q4 while RIM's shipments of smartphones declined to 6.9 million. ZTE had an excellent Q4 with 20.7 million handset shipments and 11.2 million smartphone shipments.</p>  <p>   "Samsung and Apple are both under pressure to maintain their market lead as less costly smartphones gain momentum entering 2013," notes senior practice director Jeff Orr.

Mountain View bumped YouTube Capture to version 1.1, adding support for 1080p uploads, improved audio syncing, detailed upload feedback and a grab bag of bug fixes and stability enhancements. If you're feeling particularly chatty after hamming it up for the camera, the refreshed app now allows for sharing to social networks. As for Google Currents, the latest update brings it to the two-dot-oh milestone with a number of UI upgrades. A new sidebar sorts editions by category for easy access and fresh controls let users swipe vertically to scan an edition or horizontally to skip to the next one. A brand-new catalog design, breaking stories from Google News and the ability to save articles by labeling them with stars round out the overhaul.

A price tag is MIA for the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/ics/">Android 4.0-toting</a> and Beats Audio-infused device, but the specs paint a fairly frugal picture for the hardware, which comes in black and white flavors. Behind the handset's 4-inch 800 x 480 (WVGA) display sit a single-core 1GHz processor, 512MB of RAM, 4GB of built-in storage, a microSD slot and a 5-megapixel rear-facing shooter. In terms of connectivity, the device supports 3G, WiFi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. As of now, there's no word on when it'll hit the streets in China and Taiwan or if a tweaked version with international-friendly radios will make its way to other countries.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/htc/" rel="tag">HTC</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/htc-budget-minded-desire-u/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fameblo.jp%2Fpovtc%2Fentry-11456323365.html&amp;act=url">Ameblo (translated)</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.htc.com%2Ftw%2Fsmartphones%2Fhtc-desire-u%2F">HTC</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"e5759bc030990229a03b7f85c944d09d";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:58:"Korg announces MS-20 mini, we go hands and ears-on (video)";s:4:"link";s:76:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/korg-announces-ms-20-mini-we-go-hands-on/";s:6:"author";s:10:"James Trew";s:4:"date";i:1359086700;s:7:"content";s:6322:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/korg-announces-ms-20-mini-we-go-hands-on/"><img alt="Korg announces MS-20 mini, we go hands and ears-on (video)" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04108-1359083392.jpg"></a></p><p> <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/korg">Korg</a> has a string of classic sound-making machines that bear its name. One of the most well regarded would be the MS-20 analog synth that first landed in 1978. But that's no good to you right here in 2013 is it? Well, funnily enough, the kind folk at Korg realised this, and decided to relaunch it, updated for the modern musician. The MS-20 mini is, as you might surmise, a smaller version of the classic, measuring in at 86 percent the size of the original. It also looks like as much of the character that made the MS-20 sing to people's hearts has been carried over as possible. The mini was developed by the same engineers, has the same synthesis set up (two oscillators, ring modulation, VCA design etc) complete with manual cable-patching system (which is now 3.5mm rather than 1/4-inch). There is one modern addition, and that is a USB-MIDI jack around the back, letting you plug in to your favorite DAW / sequencing software through the more contemporary connection -- should you prefer that over the good old 5-pin MIDI (which is still an option). As we're right here at NAMM, we took a stroll over to the Korg booth to take a look for ourselves. Head past the break to see / hear more.</p><p> Undoubtedly, the MS-20 mini looks like the real deal. Although smaller second time around, it's still a good size, and big enough for competent keyboard players to do their thing. The knobs and pots felt surprisingly plasticky, but the rest of the machine seems robust and well made. It's hard not to get sucked in to the whole vintage detail, especially the patch bay on the right hand side. The action on the keys feels good and responsive, and those dials should be able to take some vigorous use -- ideal for live performances. The sound it generates will definitely please fans of analog synths, and we even caught Deadmau5 making an appearance at the booth to check it out. So, if you'd like to upgrade from that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/27/just-got-an-ipad-the-best-apps-accessories-and-tips/">iPad app version</a>, to the real deal, you should be able to do so in spring, for an expected $599.

Full press release comes after that.</p><p> </p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <strong>Korg USA Announces MS-20 mini - Korg's classic MS-20 is recreated in mini size -</strong></p>  <p>   WINTER NAMM, ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA, January 24th, 2013 - Korg's MS-20 monophonic synthesizer, first introduced in 1978, is still coveted to this day for its thick, robust sound, powerful, iconic analog filter, and versatile patching options. It has now been reborn in hardware, as the new MS-20 mini. The same engineers who developed the original MS-20 have perfectly reproduced it in a body that's been shrunk to 86% of the original size, yet retains the distinctive look of the original.</p>  <p>   The MS-20 Mini offers the same distinctive synthesis that made the original MS-20 popular: two oscillators with ring modulation, and envelope generators with delay and hold. The VCA (Voltage Controlled Amp) maintains the original basic design, but it's been modified to produce less noise. Particular attention has also been paid to delivering smooth parameter adjustments, which are a distinctive feature of analog synthesizers. Special care was also taken to completely reproduce the original specifications of the MS-20, to deliver the same powerful sound, from deep, growling basses to crisp, rounded leads.</p>  <p>   One of the most well-known - and still most sought after - characteristics of the original MS-20 was its powerful filters, which provided both high-pass and low-pass with peak/resonance. Maximizing the peak/resonance would cause the filter to self-oscillate; producing a distinctive and dramatic tonal change that was acclaimed as inimitable, and was used many years later on Korg's monotron and monotribe. The filter circuit was changed mid-way through the production lifecycle of the MS-20; the MS-20 mini uses the earlier filter, which was felt to be superior due to its more radical sound.<br>   The ESP (External Signal Processor) functionality carries on the experimental spirit of MS-20, allowing users to utilize the pitch or volume of an external audio source to control the synthesizer. For example, an electric guitar can be used as an input signal, and the MS-20 mini can be used as a guitar synthesizer, or the mic input can allow it to be used it as a vocal synthesizer.</p>  <p>   The patching system enables the creation of complex sounds by allowing the rerouting of both modulation and audio (both the internal oscillators and external audio). Different combinations of the modulation input/output and trigger, sample and hold, and noise generator can produce an incredible variety of sounds. By patching according to the MS-20 flow chart printed on the panel, musicians of all levels can take advantage of these possibilities right away.</p>  <p>   To make it even more approachable, the MS-20 mini has been shrunk to 86% of the size of the original, with meticulous care taken to accurately reproduce the knob design and the printing. The patch cables have been changed from 1/4" phone plugs to mini-plugs, and the newly- designed keyboard is also 86% of the original size.</p>  <p>   The MS-20 mini is equipped with a MIDI IN jack for receiving note messages, and a USB-MIDI connector that can transmit and receive note messages. Users can also connect the MS20 mini to a computer and play it from an external sequencer.</p>  <p>   For added authenticity, the MS-20 mini packaging replicates much of the original. Also included are the original MS-20 owner's manual and settings chart.</p> </div></div><p> <em>Billy Steele contributed to this report.</em></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/misc/" rel="tag">Misc</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/korg-announces-ms-20-mini-we-go-hands-on/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"4e03f956d9a3d0bc31ea474e3e26d8da";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:85:"'Suits' Postmortem: EP Aaron Korsh, Gabriel Macht Talk Harvey and Louis' Big Showdown";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/b0VonRH6aQQ/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:11:"Philiana Ng";s:4:"date";i:1359086400;s:7:"content";s:2615:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2013/01/suits_episodic_a_l.jpg"><br>"There will always be a push and pull between Harvey and Louis," Korsh told THR.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/suits-gabriel-macht-aaron-korsh-415167" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27e04dd1/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=%27Suits%27+Postmortem%3A+EP+Aaron+Korsh%2C+Gabriel+Macht+Talk+Harvey+and+Louis%27+Big+Showdown&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fsuits-gabriel-macht-aaron-korsh-415167" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=%27Suits%27+Postmortem%3A+EP+Aaron+Korsh%2C+Gabriel+Macht+Talk+Harvey+and+Louis%27+Big+Showdown&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fsuits-gabriel-macht-aaron-korsh-415167" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

Do the loathsome words "executive customer service" resonate with you? They shouldn't if you live in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Germany/">Deutschland</a> -- at least, not after today. While that course of customer service whinging can <em>occasionally</em> yield some form of restitution stateside (we're being generous), for Germans it's now almost unnecessary. In a ruling issued today, a federal court in Karlsruhe has determined interruption of internet service to be grounds for compensation, as it can be categorized as an "essential material item," <em>Reuters</em> reports. The decision, which allows impacted users to file compensatory claims, stems from a 2008 - 2009 incident in which a private German citizen incurred a loss of phone, fax and internet service over a two month period.

While there's no further info to go along with this image, it does show off a 13MP camera on the back of the phone, which makes us wonder how Huawei even managed to pack that into the sub-6.45mm-thick metallic body. A little digging around also showed that the company's Consumer BG CEO <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/richardyu">Richard Yu</a> was seen fondling the P2 during a meeting back in December -- you can recognize the phone in the photo after the break.

While the firm has released <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/numark-refreshes-idj-live-ns7-mixtrack-pro-dj-controllers/">a whole bunch of stuff</a> at <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/namm2013">NAMM</a> this year, perhaps its most mainstream offering is the iDJ Live II. If you <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/07/11/idj-live-gives-your-ipad-two-turntables-microphone-not-included/">remember the original</a>, it was a lightweight controller (both physically, and metaphorically) designed for use with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/03/app-review-djay-for-ipad/">Djay on iOS</a>. This time around the little fella gets a redesign, and a few functionality tweaks. Most notable, is that while the first iteration only gave you the option of iOS connectivity -- via the 30-pin adaptor -- this time you have the choice of Lightning, 30-pin, or straight up USB. Thus, you can now bring the iDJ Live II out to work with your Mac or PC, too. Once again, it's built with Algoriddim's Djay in mind, be it the desktop or iOS version, and we got our hands on it to take it for a spin.

This is very much a fun, consumer product. It would be unfair to call it an accessory, but it's definitely meant for casual use at parties etc. The unit itself is very light, made entirely of plastic, and feels very different to the heavier DJ controllers you might be used to. The iDJ Live II, however, does look much better than the first iteration, with the slightly squared design and the lower-profile platters at least making it look a little less toy-like than before. The plastic finish still feels the same, as does the action and resistance of the platters, knobs and faders (which is serviceable). The controls available give you everything you need to perform all the mixing basics, with high and low-frequency EQ, channel volume control, a crossfader, and even rudimentary scratching (though it really is more of a novelty). If you've ever used Djay for any amount of time though, you'll know that this is plenty enough to get a set going, and having the physical controller there just makes it all that more enjoyable / easy. While purists and old hands might see products such as these as over simplified, the ease of use, and broad appeal makes them ideal for the curious, and that can only be a good thing. Sadly there is no word on price or availability at this time, but we'd be surprised if it wasn't comfortably under $100 when it does finally make its way onto shelves.

But amongst the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/31/50-cent-sms-audio-headphones/">celebrity</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/beats/">endorsed</a> pairs, and the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/sennheiser-orpheus-he90-headphones-ears-on/">traditional brands</a> there appears to be a gap in the market. Or, so thinks <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/akai/">Akai</a> -- the maker of the legendary <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/mpc/">MPC line</a> of beat-machines -- as it's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/05/mini-mpc-2000xl-sp1200-flash-drives-let-you-take-a-little-kany/">extending the brand</a> to include three new sets of its own: the MPC Pro, MPC, and MPC Earbuds. Akai claims the new additions are designed for use with the kit of the same name, but looking at the design, we'd wager it's not shy of taking a slice of the more image-conscious / brand aware market either. The daddy of the bunch is the MPC pro (the lower of the two you see above. These come with 50mm drivers and an over-ear design, aimed at improving isolation. The MPC model (the other pair you see above) sport 40mm drivers and an on-ear design. Both the Pro, and regular MPC editions have a metallic red and silver finish, with foldable ear-cups. The baby of the bunch is the Earbuds edition, and these are designed for "active producers," or dare we say, sporty types too. The ear-hook design is reminiscent of other sports headphone buds to keep them in place. These, however, are Bluetooth enabled too. But, if you're worried about the latency while you're producing on the go, there's a connection for going traditionally 3.5mm-cabled too.

The idea of something specific to the MPC hardware / music production, and potential for MPC-inspired design tickled us. In reality, it's hard not to think that it's more about extending the brand onto another line of products. The samples we saw on the floor were early prototypes, and not final models, so things may change, but the design and the three tiered approach suggests this is as much about market appeal as it is dedicated producer hardware. The metal finish looked well designed and reminded us of the Beats Pro line (a little too much perhaps). They fold in, which is always handy for easy storage, and there is also a mic for when using with your phone. Wearing them was comfortable enough, but with no audio to enjoy, we're unable to sample how they actually sound. So, if that turns out to be a strong point, we can happily take these as the serious producer headphones they claim to be, until then, though, we're reserving final judgement. Price and availability to follow.</p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <strong>AKAI PROFESSIONAL ANNOUNCES MPC(R) HEADPHONES</strong><br>   &shy;&shy;<br>   From concept to creation, Akai Professional now offers a fully immersive production experience with headphones and earbuds that match each new MPC in<br>   design and quality.</p>  <p>   Cumberland, R.I. (January 24, 2013) - Akai Professional, the name synonymous with music production, announces MPC Pro Headphones, MPC Headphones, and MPC Earbuds, premium personal audio devices each designed for professional music production with Akai Professional's newest line of MPCs. Akai Professional will exhibit the MPC Pro Headphones, MPC Headphones, and MPC Earbuds at Booth 6700 at the 2013 NAMM show, January 24-27 in Anaheim, California.</p>  <p>   Akai Professional's new MPC headphones and earbuds are designed to match each new MPC in design, quality, and purpose. Each is designed to empower producers with the ability to hear their tracks and hone their craft with unmatched clarity and precision. In addition, MPC headphones and earbuds provide an exceptional experience for simply listening on the go to a personal music library.</p>  <p>   MPC Pro Headphones feature powerful 50mm drivers and an over-the-ear design for premium isolation and comfort in the studio, while MPC Headphones come with precise 40mm drivers and an on-the-ear design ideal for portability and music production on the move. Both feature Akai Professional's unmatched expertise in tuning and frequency response, as well as fully adjustable headbands, pivoting ear cups, and gunmetal aluminum and steel construction for a solid, comfortable fit. Overstuffed leather cushioning on the headbands and ear cups provides a luxurious listening experience for even the most demanding studio sessions. An audio cable with 1/8-inch connector and 1/4-inch adapter is included for music production, and a communication cable with a built-in microphone is also included for use with mobile phones.</p>  <p>   "Headphones are a huge part of the production process," said Dan Gill, Akai Professional Product Manager. "With the MPC headphones and earbuds, we're simply doing what we've always done-delivering the tools musicians need to get fully immersed in their craft."</p>  <p>   Featuring lightweight soft-touch ear clips with aluminum trim and volume control, MPC Earbuds are flexible, powerful, and designed for the active producer. They're engineered to be multi-purpose with the ability to connect wirelessly via Bluetooth(R) to any compatible music player for casual cable-free listening, or to connect via the included professional audio cable for latency-free performance during music production. The built-in lithium-ion battery recharges easily via USB (cable included). MPC Earbuds deliver Akai Professional's superior tuning and frequency response for any track via precise 13mm drivers. Producers can go wired or wireless by connecting or disconnecting the included 1/8-inch cable from the Akai Professional medallion that is located on the cable between the earbuds. The medallion also includes a built-in mic for using MPC Earbuds with a mobile phone.</p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/" rel="tag">Home Entertainment</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/akai-launches-mpc-headphone-series/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"16728d8af6d98464271e1cb08eb52df9";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:59:"Craig Robinson, Greg Daniels Comedy Gets Pilot Order at NBC";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/gkIvfmKZ3JI/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:27:"Lacey Rose, Lesley Goldberg";s:4:"date";i:1359080582;s:7:"content";s:2698:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2012/10/craig_robinson_greg_daniels.jpg"><br>The Robinson vehicle will center around a talented musician, who adjusts to his new life as a middle school music teacher, where he maneuvers precocious kids, teacher politics, and the temptations of single moms. <p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/craig-robinson-greg-daniels-comedy-415296" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27e00f34/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Craig+Robinson%2C+Greg+Daniels+Comedy+Gets+Pilot+Order+at+NBC&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fcraig-robinson-greg-daniels-comedy-415296" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Craig+Robinson%2C+Greg+Daniels+Comedy+Gets+Pilot+Order+at+NBC&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fcraig-robinson-greg-daniels-comedy-415296" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

Once we hit the show floor here in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/namm2013/">California</a>, we made sure to drop by for live look. The analog unit features every bit of the fine craftsmanship that we've come to know Moog for crankin' out of its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/23/visualized-moog-factory-tour/">factory</a> in the mountains of North Carolina despite the affordable $1,100 price tag. Sub Phatty keeps with the classic snyth aesthetic and Moog design trademarks including soft-touch coated side panels -- a staple of the Phatty line -- and knobs that look and feel prime for extreme mileage. Aside from a dapper exterior, the big draw here is the new Multidrive tech that graces the control panel and inner workings of the device. We could give a detailed textual explanation of said feature, but we'll let Amos Gaynes, product development specialist at Moog, do all of the chatting in the video that follows after the break. Speaking of the jump, you'll find an audio sample taken straight off of the Sub Phatty's frontside here at NAMM 2013.</p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on/">Moog Sub Phatty analog synthesizer hands-on</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on/5594308"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04031-1359061826_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on/5594309"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04032-1359061828_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on/5594324"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04059-1359061851_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on/5594323"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04057-1359061849_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on/5594330"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04094-1359061861_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><p> </p><p> </p><p> <em>James Trew contributed to this report.</em></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/misc/" rel="tag">Misc</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/moog-sub-phatty-analog-synthesizer-hands-on-video/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"4d144f857942c7ca74cea10d463edd33";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:72:"Belkin to acquire Cisco's home division, scoop up Linksys in the process";s:4:"link";s:78:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/belkin-acquire-cisco-home-division-linksys/";s:6:"author";s:13:"Alexis Santos";s:4:"date";i:1359076380;s:7:"content";s:6002:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/belkin-acquire-cisco-home-division-linksys/"><img alt="Belkin to acquire Cisco's home division, scoop up Linksys in the process" data-src-height="300" data-src-width="580" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/blekin-cisco.jpg"></a></p><p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Belkin/">Belkin</a> has just struck a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/16/cisco-selling-linksys/">deal</a> to acquire Cisco's Home Networking Business Unit, which will bring <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Linksys/">Linksys'</a> name, products, technology and employees under its new owner's umbrella.

His research interest in pictorial part of the human condition, treated with humor, irony and a strong degree of provocation, and reflects on a society full of taboos and subjected to a very visual tyranny of television, advertising and, of course, of fashion magazines. With the model representations and contemporary references in behavior and appearance, beauty and glamor, extracted from the coated paper for magazines, Guim makes a pictorial opera(c)tion through brilliantly combined with the photographic medium - to "eye surgery": a metaphor for the physical manipulation of plastic surgery, genetics and cybernetics, revealing that dark part of the human soul hided behind the pretense of perfection. The artist stages a controversial issue for contemporary society and his work becomes an exploration of the collective unconscious, which governs the aesthetic valences on all types of human monstrosities in the sign of narcissistic beauty emulation as the key to success; a parody of stereotypes that today govern the new conceptions of the meaning "human being".

Supposedly, it's a combination of spam filters actually working, the authentication of senders and more police crackdowns on Nigerian princes. In fact, in the past year, junk mail has declined from around 80% to 67%. Do you guys agree with this study?

Today, we swung by the company's booth to take a closer look and spend a few minutes with the Bluetooth-wielding wireless duo. The first thing that we noticed was the build quality. Both the iLoud and iLoud Mini sport a soft-touch rubber-esque coating on the top and bottom that we've seen in other Bluetooth audio units. The pair also has an adequate amount of heft without being overbearing when added to the weight of an already packed rucksack. In terms of the Mini, a single volume control rests on the right side, both USB port (for charging) and aux inputs reside around to the left and the power button is at home up top.</p><p> For us, the real star of the show here is the regular iLoud. In addition to the same wireless capabilities as the smaller sibling, this unit packs a 1/4-inch input that houses the outfit's iRig circuitry. Essentially, one of IK Mulitmedia's adapters is crammed right into the speaker. Said jack along with controls for power, gain and Bluetooth pairing hit the backside in addition to an auxiliary port for connecting a handset or tablet via cable. The volume knob is around front on this beefier model, encircled in a glowing red light. One of the main selling points is the advertised studio-grade sound quality -- especially in the 40W iLoud -- which we were unfortunately unable to confirm due to the overly noisy show floor here in Anaheim. Jump down through the gallery to take a gander at the pair that is set to arrive in Q2 for $300 and $200 respectively. </p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on/">IK Multimedia iLoud and iLoud Mini hands-on</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on/5594093"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04000_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on/5594094"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04001-1359057847_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on/5594096"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04003-1359057855_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on/5594097"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04004-1359057857_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on/5594098"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc04005-1359057861_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><p> </p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/portable-audio-video/" rel="tag">Portable Audio/Video</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/ik-multimedia-iloud-and-iloud-mini-hands-on-video/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"51bdd30a540e57c651ac25d85fc527af";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:93:"Which Way Is the Front Line From Here?

Overall revenue was also up, showing a gain of 18.5 percent from the same period last year for a total of 56.06 trillion won ($52.04 billion.) The company reported "strong" sales of its tablets and smartphones, specifically calling out its Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II, which last seen crashing through the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/02/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-30-million/">30 million</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/25/samsung-galaxy-note-ii-5-million-sold/">5 million sold</a> barriers, respectively.

Samsung sees the 60-inch and higher market growing in 2013, however Q1 sales are expected to be slow before the new models are introduced. Samsung is also a major chip maker, and it reported weak demand for PC RAM, but growth in the server and mobile markets.

Consolidated operating profit for the quarter hit 8.84 trillion won, representing a 10-percent increase on-quarter, while consolidated net profit for the same quarter was 7.04 trillion won.</p>  <p>   The full-year 2012 operating profit was 29.05 trillion won on revenue of 201.10 trillion won.</p>  <p>   In its earnings guidance disclosed on January 8, Samsung estimated fourth quarter consolidated revenues would reach approximately 56 trillion won with consolidated operating profit of approximately 8.8 trillion won.</p>  <p>   Highlighting the quarterly performance, Mobile Communications generated quarterly revenues of 27.23 trillion won, a 4-percent increase compared with the previous quarter. The growth was mainly driven by solid sales of Samsung's GALAXY S IIl and GALAXY Note ll. All told, operating profit for IT &amp; Mobile Communications, which encompasses four business units including Mobile Communications, was 5.44 trillion won on revenues of 31.32 trillion won.</p>  <p>   "Despite uncertainties in Europe and concerns over the U.S. fiscal cliff creating a difficult business environment, we did our best this quarter to achieve strong earnings based on a strategic focus on differentiated and high value-added products as well as our technological competitiveness," said Robert Yi, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations.</p>  <p>   "Heading into this year, we are expecting a slow recovery in the component business due to reduced capital expenditures, while competition in the set business will intensify further as demand slows and the mid- to low-end market expands," he added. Mr. Yi also expressed caution over the continued strength of the Korean won in 2013.</p>  <p>   Samsung's standout lineup of LED TVs, including premium models targeting advanced markets and TVs tailored to emerging markets, has also improved quarter-on-quarter earnings. Although demand for home appliances retreated in the December quarter due to a tepid global economy, Samsung saw increased sales of high-end refrigerators and washers in the U.S. and in European markets.</p>  <p>   On the components business side, demand for PC DRAM remained weak but growth of high value-added products such as server and mobile DRAM was constant due to increased sales of mobile devices. While the Semiconductor Business landed profits in the quarter, the Display Panel segment struggled, as demand for IT panels for notebooks and monitors remained slow. On the other hand, profitability in LCD panels for TVs and OLED panels for smartphones prevented wider losses.</p>  <p>   As for this year's capital expenditure, the size of investment is expected to be similar to that of 2012's.The weakening global economic recovery and looming market uncertainties are anticipated to weigh on plans for investment and performance this year, but despite global economic jitters, Samsung will respond to the market's ebb and flow with a capex plan that is flexible in manner.</p>  <p>   Differentiated Product Mix to Alleviate Chip Supply Squeeze</p>  <p>   Samsung's Semiconductor Businesses - including Memory and System LSI - posted consolidated 9.59 trillion won in revenue, a 10-percent hike from a quarter earlier. The Memory chip unit accounted for 5.33 trillion won in earnings and with the logic chip unit yielded 1.42 trillion won in operating profits, up 39 percent on-quarter</p>  <p>   The Semiconductor Business sustained profitability in the quarter, amid weak market demand, thanks to a mix of high-margin products such as servers and Solid State Drives (SSDs) coupled with differentiated 20-nanometer class NAND flash chips. A competitive edge in mobile application processors for smartphones and tablet PCs also contributed to the bottom line.</p>  <p>   Looking ahead, demand for memory chips is expected to be stifled in the first quarter, due to the seasonably weak demand for PCs and mobile devices. However, for the remainder of 2013, high value-added DRAM for mobile devices and servers will sustain profitability. Demand for logic products and NAND solutions including SSDs will remain strong throughout the year, as the industry puts greater emphasis on devices with higher capacity, greater processing power and mobility.</p>  <p>   High-End Panels Secure Stability</p>  <p>   The Display Panel Business recorded an operating profit of 1.11 trillion won on revenue of 7.75 trillion won in the fourth quarter. This represented a 5-percent decline in profits compared with the previous quarter but was up from the corresponding quarter of 2011.</p>  <p>   Despite slower-than-expected economic recovery in developed markets, panel demand in China and emerging economies remained favorable in the quarter. This was led by solid sales of TV and tablet panels which offset the slowdown in notebook and monitor panel demand.</p>  <p>   Samsung was able to secure stable growth for the quarter with an improved product mix and strengthened sales of high-end panels. Sales of LED and narrow bezel panels for premium TVs continued to grow, although the company's TV panel sales dropped in the mid single-digit percentage range from the same period last year. However, increased sales of tablet panels as well as OLED panels for premium smartphones contributed to steady growth.</p>  <p>   Looking ahead to 2013, the company expects the market for large-size TV panels, those over 60 inches in size, to grow. Strong sales of tablet panels are also forecast to continue throughout the year. For the first quarter, however, panel demand is expected to be adversely affected by off-peak seasonality before recovering in March with new TV and tablet product launches by manufactures.</p>  <p>   Emerging Markets, a Silver Lining</p>  <p>   The IT &amp; Mobile Communications - comprised of Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Imaging and Media Solution Center businesses - posted operating profits of 5.44 trillion won on 31.32 trillion won in revenue for the period. Out of the total IM earnings, the handset-making unit claimed 27.23 trillion won in revenue in the October-December quarter.</p>  <p>   Samsung led gains with its full lineup of entry- to mid-level smartphones, expanded sales of tablet PCs and an increase in average selling price (ASP) from the previous quarter. The success was mainly brought on by strong sales of GALAXY S III and GALAXY Note II, which beat the popularity of their predecessors with record sales in record time.</p>  <p>   In contrast, growth in network and IT-related IM businesses was stunted by heated pricing in the fourth quarter. On a brighter note, sales of Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless broadband technology equipment continued gains while revenue from overseas sales of notebook PCs improved.</p>  <p>   The furious growth spurt seen in the global smartphone market last year is expected to be pacified by intensifying price competition compounded by a slew of new products. In the first quarter, demand for smartphones in developed countries is expected to decelerate, while their emerging counterparts will see their markets escalate with the introduction of more affordable smartphones and a bigger appetite for tablet PCs throughout the year.</p>  <p>   LED TVs Drive Growth</p>  <p>   The Consumer Electronics Division - encompassing the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses - posted revenue of 13.95 trillion won for the quarter, up 20 percent quarter-on-quarter. The operating profit of 740 billion won amounted to an increase of 87 percent on the previous quarter and an increase on-year.</p>  <p>   Lifted by peak season sales, the market experienced stronger demand for TV products in both developed and emerging markets as LED TV sales drove overall market growth of over 40 percent on-quarter. Backed by favorable market conditions, Samsung outperformed the market for LED TVs with on-quarter growth of more than 50 percent. This was achieved by the company's differentiated strategy of focusing on premium models for developed economies and region-specific models in emerging markets.</p>  <p>   Heading into 2013, sales will be led by emerging economies and the LED TV segment, which will expand its proportion of total TV sales into the mid-80 percent range. In the first quarter, the company expects off-peak seasonality to dampen on-quarter growth, although demand will be up in comparison with the previous year.</p>  <p>   For the Digital Appliances market, although global economic conditions pushed demand down on the previous quarter, Samsung was able to expand sales of premium refrigerators and washing machines as the company experienced growth in developed markets such as Europe and the U.S. Looking ahead, the company expects moderate growth in emerging markets while low growth is likely to continue in developed economies.</p>  <p>   About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</p>  <p>   Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in consumer electronics and the core components that go into them.

To that end, it's coming to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/namm2013/">NAMM</a> with a trio of options that cover most Apple-bound musicians and podcasters. Its next-generation One interface (seen after the break) can take simultaneous input from both a built-in condenser mic and one device plugged into either an XLR or quarter-inch jack, passing along the resulting tunes to an iOS device or a Mac's USB port. A similarly reworked Duet adds direct iOS connections to the two-input, four-output Duet (above). Full-fledged bands aren't left out of the equation, either -- the existing, four-input Quartet has received iPad support without changing its formula. Lighting-based iOS gear unfortunately requires an adapter, but we'll take consolation in a new Maestro app for iPads that offers control over connections and session monitoring. Producers hoping for more mobility can pick up the Duet or Quartet in February at their respective $595 and $1,295 prices, although they'll have to wait until March to buy the One at $349.</p><p> <img alt="Apogee intros revamped One and Duet audio interfaces for iOS and Mac, updates Quartet to match" data-src-height="450" data-src-width="193" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/apogee-one.jpg"></p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <em><strong>Apogee Electronics introduces all new "ONE", audio interface &amp; microphone featuring iPad &amp; Mac compatibility, upgraded sound quality and new Maestro control app for iOS</strong></em></p>  <p>   <em>Anaheim, California, January 24, 2013 - Apogee Electronics is pleased to introduce the completely redesigned ONE, a 2 IN x 2 OUT USB audio interface and microphone. The all new ONE is the first studio quality audio interface and microphone that makes a direct digital connection to Apple's iPad (iPhone, iPod touch) and Mac. ONE features Apogee's Maestro control software, iOS device charging, optional battery power for portable recording with iPad and professional sound quality. ONE is the all-in-one solution that makes it easy for musicians, songwriters, recording engineers, film makers, audiophiles, and anyone else to enjoy professional sound quality on iPad and Mac.</em></p>  <p>   <em>ONE offers three input options; a built-in omni-directional condenser microphone, XLR input for dynamic, condenser or ribbon microphones, and 1/4" instrument input for electric guitars, keyboards or any instrument with an electric pick-up. An upgrade from the original design, ONE now has the ability to record two inputs simultaneously (instrument plus built-in microphone or external microphone). The updated AD/DA converters and mic preamps deliver best-in-class, studio quality sound and allow you to capture and playback your recordings with incredible clarity and detail.</em></p>  <p>   <em>ONE's audiophile quality headphone amplifier/DAC is a favorite for enhanced music listening on Mac. Now ONE delivers the same hi-fi quality sound to iPod touch, iPhone and iPad users for listening to streaming radio and music libraries with incredible clarity and detail.</em></p>  <p>   <em>ONE's built-in condenser microphone is a unique feature allowing anyone to record with incredible results and without the need for an external microphone. This paired with the option of connecting to iPod touch, iPhone or iPad and battery power enables studio-quality recordings to be created in any location.</em></p>  <p>   <em>"We have completely redesigned ONE, incorporating highly anticipated features; iPad compatibility, simultaneous recording of guitar and a microphone, enhanced sound quality, and a much desired metal chassis," says Apogee CEO and Co-Founder Betty Bennett. "This is an innovative interface, ideal for the musician who wants an all-in-one solution they can count on for ease of use and professional studio quality results, no matter where they are. We're excited to welcome this next generation of a classic Apogee product and we know our customers will love it."</em></p>  <p>   <em>Apple's iPad has revolutionized music creation with an intuitive touch interface and a universe of powerful and very affordable music apps.

Beyond just games, you can snag any content available on SEN and snag it later for full download and install on your PlayStation 3, Vita, PSP, and Xperia devices. Sadly, it's not anywhere near as convenient as its Xbox 360 equivalent -- after queuing up downloads, users have to dig around in the My Downloads section of their XMB and manually select which content to pull down. Still, a step in the right direction (and only two months after <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/07/sony-launches-webstore-for-playstation-games-movies-and-tv-shows/">Europe got the service</a>).

With an unprecedented amount of content now available in the PlayStation(R)Store (PS Store), the online store delivers a convenient and visually compelling destination for users to access, discover and enjoy digital entertainment.</p>  <p>   For PlayStation users, content purchased in the new online store from a PC (Mac and Windows) is added to My Downloads within the PlayStation Store. Users can then download games, movies and TV episodes directly onto their PlayStation(R)3, PlayStation(R)Vita, or PlayStation(R)Portable systems. Users can also purchase movies and TV episodes via the online store from any PC and watch them via the Media Go application (Windows-based PC only), or on Sony Xperia smartphones and tablets.</p>  <p>   The launch of the online store follows the recent release of the new PS Store for the PS3 system and is part of an on-going initiative of redesigning the various device user experiences. Sony Entertainment Network will continue to update the PlayStation Store and online store with new features that improve usability and convenience for finding, purchasing and accessing content. For example, users of the new online store can look forward to the future addition of advanced recommendation functionality and automatic remote download of purchased content, as well as mobile phone and tablet browsing.</p>  <p>   The online store was first available in European territories in December 2012. Today, the online store expands to the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil.

Well, if Pioneer's latest special edition hardware is anything to go by, it's a love of shiny things. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/pioneer-intros-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-and-more/">Announced this week</a>, the limited-run of it's flagship CDJ2000nexus, DJM-900nexus and RMX-1000 remix station DJ gear is all about the looks. We managed to get there the minute the show floor opened, and found the lustrous kit getting the final spit and polish before the eager hoards could get their curious hands on it. As anyone who has used Pioneer DJ kit will know, the build quality is generally high, and this is still the case here. The metallic finish really makes them something to look at, and we can see this being the set-up of choice for those who like to show off a little. With that in mind, you might be thinking what we were: what about fingerprints? Well, having got there first, meant that they had yet to endure the proper real-world challenge, but we were kind enough to apply a few firm presses to the gear in the name of science. The result? Well, let's just say that you might want to keep a lint-free cloth close to hand. But then if you're the kind to lay down the suggested $8,499 for the whole set, we imagine you might have thought that far ahead already. Check the gallery below to see the whole set, up close and personal.<span><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/pioneer-pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-mixer-and-remixer-eyes-on/">Pioneer Pioneer Platinum Edition CDJ-2000nexus, mixer and remixer eyes-on</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/pioneer-pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-mixer-and-remixer-eyes-on/5594142"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc03966-1359059466_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/pioneer-pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-mixer-and-remixer-eyes-on/5594143"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc03967-1359059472_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/pioneer-pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-mixer-and-remixer-eyes-on/5594144"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc03968-1359059474_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/pioneer-pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-mixer-and-remixer-eyes-on/5594145"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc03969_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/pioneer-pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj-2000nexus-mixer-and-remixer-eyes-on/5594146"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/dsc03970-1359059486_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div></span></p><p> <em>Billy Steele contributed to this report.</em></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/misc/" rel="tag">Misc</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/24/pioneer-platinum-edition-cdj2000nexus-djm-900nexus-and-rmx-1000/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"6dc0316f8483ba778b5aeaaaae4df9a9";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:70:"How Digital Comics Change the Way Comic Books are Drawn—And Imagined";s:4:"link";s:122:"http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/DWkRgGiEAcc/how-digital-comics-change-the-way-comic-books-are-drawnand-imagined";s:6:"author";s:8:"Jim Rugg";s:4:"date";i:1359066000;s:7:"content";s:2242:"<div> <!-- div style="background-color: #B3B3B3; width: 190px; padding: 1px;"><a title="Click here to read How Digital Comics Change the Way Comic Books are Drawn&#38;mdash;And Imagined" href="http://gizmodo.com/comic-books/" style="background-color:#888888; color:#FFFFFF; font-size:12px;text-align:right; display:block; height:14px; padding:1px 2px; text-decoration:none; text-transform:uppercase; width:156px;"><span style="color: white;" class="hash">#</span><span style="color: white;">comicbooks</span></a></div --> <div><a title="Click here to read How Digital Comics Change the Way Comic Books are Drawn&amp;mdash;And Imagined" href="http://gizmodo.com/5978756/how-digital-comics-change-the-way-comic-books-are-drawnand-imagined"> <img height="360" width="640" title="Click here to read How Digital Comics Change the Way Comic Books are Drawn&amp;mdash;And Imagined" alt="Click here to read How Digital Comics Change the Way Comic Books are Drawn&amp;mdash;And Imagined" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18856ama73homjpg/xlarge.jpg"></a></div> </div> Mike Mignola returned to monthly comic books with Hellboy in Hell (December 2012).

As for the rest of the Yolo's specs, you'll be looking at Android 4.0 on a 3.5-inch display and snapping pictures with a 5-megapixel shooter capable of recording 1080p HD video. Not looking to compete with top-shelf handsets, Safaricom hopes to catch the eye of frugal first-time buyers with this budget-friendly device. <span>If you fit the bill, you may want to check out the Yolo as soon as possible -- after all, your phone only lives once.</span></p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <strong>Safaricom, Intel Introduce Yolo[TM], Africa's First Smartphone with Intel Inside</strong></p>  <p>   Nairobi, Kenya, 24th January 2013 -- Leading integrated communications provider Safaricom Limited today announced the Yolo[TM] smartphone, the first smartphone for Africa with Intel Inside(R).<br><br>   The device is aimed at the growing number of cost-conscious and first-time buyers in Kenya who do not want to sacrifice device performance or user experience for cost. The Yolo smartphone will be sold in Safaricom shops countrywide at the entry price of Kshs. 10,999 and comes bundled with free 500 MB data.<br><br>   The phone is based on Intel's latest smartphone platform for emerging markets, launched earlier this month at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES). With Intel Inside, users of the Yolo smartphone are assured of fast Web browsing, impressive multimedia capabilities and a great Android* applications experience.<br><br>   "We're redefining what cost-conscious Kenyans can expect from a smartphone," said Peter Arina, general manager, Safaricom' s Consumer Business Unit. "The Intel-based Yolo smartphone strikes a unique balance between price and performance - we consider it to be a real breakthrough. It's great news that Kenya will be the launch country in Africa for smartphones with Intel Inside and we expect a great reception from our customers."<br><br>   "We are delighted to partner with Safaricom in bringing the first smartphone with Intel Inside to Kenyan consumers" said Aysegul Ildeniz, Regional Director for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa Region. "The new handset extends the benefits of Intel technology to more smartphone users around the world and we believe that Kenyan consumers will welcome the increased functionality and overall value of the device. We look forward to our continued cooperation with Safaricom."<br><br>   The Yolo[TM] smartphone is based on the Intel Smartphone Reference Design for the value segment of the smartphone market. The device is powered by the Intel(R) Atom[TM] processor Z2420 with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology that can achieve speeds of up to 1.2 GHz. The efficiency of this technology package helps to enable a smooth and responsive user experience, which includes support for 1080p HD video capture, and a camera with advanced imaging capabilities, including burst mode that allows people to capture seven pictures in a second in 5-megapixel quality.<br><br>   The device is housed in a compact design and features a 3.5-inch touchscreen display for crisp text and images, support for FM radio and an expandable memory slot for greater flexibility, and HSPA+ modem support with Intel's XMM 6265 modem for global roaming.

However, the company's also posting "record smartphone sales" of 10.2 million last quarter -- "the most by any US carrier," it claims. As it's Q4, the results for the full year are also in; AT&amp;T revealed $7.3 billion in net income across the entirety of 2012. That's what we'd call a <em>marked change</em> from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/26/atandt-q4-2011-revenues-up-3-6-percent-7-6-million/">last year's losses</a>.</p><p> In terms of phones, AT&amp;T activated 8.6 million new iPhone customers (16 percent of which were totally new to the company), up 1 million over 2011's Q4 and nearly double that of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/24/att-q3-2012/">Q3 2012</a>. No specific number is given on Android sign-ups, but AT&amp;T's calling it the "best-ever sales quarter for Android smartphones" -- when those 8.6 million iPhones are subtracted from the overall Q4 2012 sales of phones (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/08/us-att-smartphonesales-idUSBRE9070JC20130108">10 million</a>), it's not looking so good for non-Apple built devices. On the U-verse front, the latest lifetime subscriber numbers reflect 8 million TV and high-speed internet users, with 192K joining in Q4 2012.</p><p> Operating revenues just barely exceeded those of 2011, reaching $127.4 billion, offset by $114.4 billion in expenses (down $3 billion over 2011). Customer numbers also grew in 2012, by a healthy 1.086 million people, the vast majority of which are contract customers (approximately 70 percent). Needless to say, things seem to have gone <em>pretty okay</em> for AT&amp;T in 2012, despite a rocky final quarter. Not too bad for the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/29/consumer-reports-verizon-ranked-the-best-major-us-carrier-this/">least loved mobile carrier in the US</a>.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> This post originally reflected $3.9 billion in profit for Q4 2012, when it should've reflected losses.

According to <em>AnandTech</em>, the company will release boards that are based on the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/haswell/">Haswell</a> architecture before completely suspending development. Moving forward, Intel will instead focus its efforts on creating form factor reference designs for the Ultrabook, tablet and desktop markets. Curiously, one product that's currently immune from the announcement is the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/14/intels-core-i3-nuc-mini-system-bares-it-all-for-idf-hands-on-v/">Next Unit of Computing</a> (NUC), a miniature barebones system that will see continual development from Intel. While custom PC builders will likely take a moment to reflect upon the news, it's said that the transition is unlikely to affect the company's workforce. Instead, current employees will be absorbed into other divisions within Intel. After all, there's no point in showing talented engineers to the door, even in an age of market shifts.</p><p> [Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/huangjiahui/">huangjiahui</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/huangjiahui/4907798630/">Flickr</a>]</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/desktops/" rel="tag">Desktops</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/intel/" rel="tag">Intel</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/intel-will-discontinue-desktop-motherboards/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6685/the-end-of-an-era-intels-desktop-motherboard-business-to-ramp-down-over-next-3-years">AnandTech</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"c3b1e96268d0dd0e64e579ee67232a4d";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:70:"The No-Hire Emails That That Incriminate Apple, Google, Adobe and More";s:4:"link";s:119:"http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/_71k4vedTgI/the-no+hire-emails-that-that-involve-apple-google-adobe-and-more";s:6:"author";s:15:"Jamie Condliffe";s:4:"date";i:1358928019;s:7:"content";s:2138:"<div> <!-- div style="background-color: #B3B3B3; width: 190px; padding: 1px;"><a title="Click here to read The No-Hire Emails That That Incriminate Apple, Google, Adobe and More" href="http://gizmodo.com/business/" style="background-color:#888888; color:#FFFFFF; font-size:12px;text-align:right; display:block; height:14px; padding:1px 2px; text-decoration:none; text-transform:uppercase; width:156px;"><span style="color: white;" class="hash">#</span><span style="color: white;">business</span></a></div --> <div><a title="Click here to read The No-Hire Emails That That Incriminate Apple, Google, Adobe and More" href="http://gizmodo.com/5978223/the-no+hire-emails-that-that-involve-apple-google-adobe-and-more"> <img height="360" width="640" title="Click here to read The No-Hire Emails That That Incriminate Apple, Google, Adobe and More" alt="Click here to read The No-Hire Emails That That Incriminate Apple, Google, Adobe and More" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18ccxwqgcldr0png/xlarge.png"></a></div> </div> A court filing has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/business-us-apple-google-lawsuit-idUKBRE90M04Y20130123">just been made public </a>which sheds light on the "no-hire" gentleman's agreements that have pervaded the tech industry&mdash;and reveals how Steve Jobs threatened litigation to prevent companies from stealing his staff. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5978223/the-no+hire-emails-that-that-involve-apple-google-adobe-and-more" title="Click here to read more about The No-Hire Emails That That Incriminate Apple, Google, Adobe and More">More&nbsp;&raquo;</a> <br><img width="1" height="1" src="http://gizmodo.feedsportal.com/c/34976/f/647164/s/27cdbe61/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884975546/u/49/f/647164/c/34976/s/27cdbe61/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884975546/u/49/f/647164/c/34976/s/27cdbe61/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884975546/u/49/f/647164/c/34976/s/27cdbe61/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~4/_71k4vedTgI" height="1" width="1">";s:9:"feed_link";s:19:"http://gizmodo.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:7:"Gizmodo";}s:32:"892e47c3f703002abc3d7727a1ab4719";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:82:"White House unveils National Day of Civic Hacking to solve problems with open data";s:4:"link";s:77:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/white-house-national-day-of-civic-hacking/";s:6:"author";s:13:"Alexis Santos";s:4:"date";i:1358924520;s:7:"content";s:2188:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/white-house-national-day-of-civic-hacking/"><img alt="White House unveils National Day of Civic Hacking to solve problems with open data" data-src-height="340" data-src-width="620" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/civichacking.jpg"></a></p><p> Sure, the freshly announced National Day of Civic Hacking may sound like it'll occupy a single square on your calendar, but the White House wants folks to get together on June 1st <em>and</em> 2nd to solve problems with a bit of coding and info from Uncle Sam. Government agencies including the Census Bureau, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/NASA/">NASA</a> and the Department of Labor are set to serve up publicly available data for developers and entrepreneurs to concoct solutions for problems affecting cities, states and the country. In addition to government support, the effort is being organized by outfits including Code for America, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/random-hacks-of-kindness-brings-hackers-together-for-the-greater/">Random Hacks of Kindness</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/EricSchmidt/">Eric Schmidt's</a> Innovation Endeavors.

BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 re-invents RIM's EMM by bringing together device management, industry leading security, and mobile applications management for BlackBerry smartphones, BlackBerry PlayBook tablets, and new BlackBerry 10 smartphones in a consolidated solution. It also provides a single console for managing BlackBerry, Android and iOS devices.</em></p>  <p>   <em>BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 builds on more than a decade of RIM's enterprise mobility management expertise and the most widely deployed mobility solution in enterprises today. BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 offers mobile device management, mobile application management and secure mobile connectivity, and delivers a cost-efficient and reliable solution for business customers.</em></p>  <p>   <em>"BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 empowers employees to be more productive and better equipped to serve customers while it provides business and IT leaders with the confidence that corporate data is protected and manageable in the same way they have long enjoyed with BlackBerry," said Peter Devenyi, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Software, Research In Motion. "BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 makes mobility easy for businesses to help keep them moving."</em></p>  <p>   <em>Flexible Enterprise Mobility Management<br>   BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 gives organizations a highly scalable solution and the flexibility to manage their mobile deployment as needed. It supports both corporate-owned and personal-owned (BYOD - Bring Your Own Device) device deployments and mixed environments of BlackBerry and other devices, providing mobile device management, mobile application management, and secure access to corporate data. It includes an intuitive, unified, web-based administration console to manage devices and users. It also supports BlackBerry Balance technology, which elegantly separates and secures work applications and data from personal content on BlackBerry devices. BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 is built on the same security and connectivity model for BlackBerry 10 smartphones that enterprise customers have always trusted and relied upon with BlackBerry Enterprise Server.</em></p>  <p>   <em>Key Features for BlackBerry 10 smartphones with BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10</em></p>  <p>   <em>Support for secure separation of work and personal applications and data on BlackBerry 10 smartphones through BlackBerry Balance technology.<br>   Support for seamless and secure access to work email, content and secure connectivity to "behind the firewall" applications and data.<br>   BlackBerry World for Work, the new corporate app storefront for BlackBerry 10 smartphones that allows organizations to easily manage apps for employees. Administrators can push and install the organization's mandatory apps to both corporate and personal-owned devices and publish recommended apps to employees.<br>   Rich management controls for securing and managing work profiles including hierarchical group management with Active Directory integration, support for customizable administrative roles with granular capabilities, an intuitive enterprise enrollment process for employees that offers a self-service console, and centralized control of assignable profiles for email, SCEP, Wi-Fi, VPN and proxy servers.<br><br>   What Customers Are Saying</em></p>  <p>   <em>"The BlackBerry solution has been meeting our enterprise mobility needs for 10 years and it's been incredibly exciting to be among the first UK customers to try out BlackBerry 10," said Craig Allcock, Head of Networks, Group Technology, The Co-operative Group. "The re-designed UI is excellent, providing a smooth experience which enables you to seamlessly switch between applications and content across both the personal and work profiles. We're confident that BlackBerry 10 smartphones and the new BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 will enable us to both anticipate and meet the existing and future enterprise mobility needs of our individual employees."</em></p>  <p>   <em>"We've been testing BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 in our environment and we're pleased with the manageability, security and reliability that the solution offers, along with expanded management capabilities to other devices within our network," said Peter E. Lesser, Director of Global Technology, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP. "BlackBerry has been a trusted partner of ours for many years, and we're excited to implement BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 in our organization."</em></p>  <p>   <em>What Industry Analysts Are Saying</em></p>  <p>   <em>"BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 brings some important technology, cost and operational improvements to existing BlackBerry customers," said Nick McQuire, Research Director Mobile Enterprise Strategies EMEA for IDC. "We believe RIM is poised to capitalize on its strong history in delivering reliable, scalable and secure mobile enterprise management solutions to help organizations address an increasingly diverse mobile environment."</em></p>  <p>   <em>"Companies require maximum flexibility and diversity in mobile deployments," said Jack Gold, principal analyst of J.Gold Associates, LLC. "Products that manage multiple platforms, while at the same time enabling the segregation of personal and corporate data, represent an optimum solution by offering the lowest total cost of ownership, most end-user friendly, and highest security approach to enterprise mobility."</em></p>  <p>   <em>Availability</em></p>  <p>   <em>The BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 software as well as a limited sixty (60) day free trial (includes client access licenses) is available to be ordered here.</em></p>  <p>   <em>Through the BlackBerry 10 Ready Program, existing customers can take advantage of the free license trade up program at www.blackberry.com/licensetradeup, which is available until December 31, 2013.**</em></p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/rim/" rel="tag">RIM</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/blackberry-enterprise-service-10-download/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://crackberry.com/blackberry-enterprise-service-10-bes-10-now-available-download">CrackBerry</a><!--//-->, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/rim-lets-blackberry-enterprise-service-10-out-of-the-gate-early-ready-for-blackberry-10-phones-7000010133/">ZDNet</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"da89c7cd5010875ed339721d45d40477";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:27:"Sound City: Sundance Review";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/tCb3fMtQhGI/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:12:"David Rooney";s:4:"date";i:1358921284;s:7:"content";s:2577:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2013/01/screen_shot_2013-01-18_at_3.31.50_pm.png"><br>Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Tom Petty and Trent Reznor are among the many artists and producers reflecting on the contribution to American music of the Van Nuys studio in Dave Grohl's impassioned tribute.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/sound-city/review/414710" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27cd52cf/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Sound+City%3A+Sundance+Review&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fmovie%2Fsound-city%2Freview%2F414710" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Sound+City%3A+Sundance+Review&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fmovie%2Fsound-city%2Freview%2F414710" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

In 2012, over 60 million <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/td-scdma">TD-SCDMA</a> devices were sold, with December alone pumping out over seven million units. To put that into perspective, there are now over 220 million 3G phone users in China (as of end of November), meaning the carrier still has plenty of catching up to do as it had a late start in the 3G game. That said, Wang also announced that China Mobile aims to sell twice as many TD-SCDMA devices this year, with smartphones expected to take up over 80 percent of that segment -- hardly a challenge considering they already reached 94.4 percent in the last quarter. Wang added that out of the 120 million units to be sold this year, half of them will be customized by China Mobile -- presumably so that it can choose its own bloatware, right?</p><p> As for <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/td-lte/">TD-LTE</a>, China Mobile expects its 4G technology to bloom in China some time between 2014 and 2015, as it continues to help the development of devices that natively support five modes (GSM, TD-SCDMA, UMTS, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/18/zte-grand-era-lte-launches-in-hong-kong-with-dual-mode-lte/">FD-LTE and TD-LTE</a>) along with 10 to 12 bands. Obviously this is the very reason why China Mobile is getting cosy with Qualcomm, the company who has SoCs that support all these radios. Wang added that ahead of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/china-speeds-up-lte-schedule/">full launch of TD-LTE</a>, his company will be initiating user trials for TD-LTE data devices and phones throughout 2013 -- the first half of the year for the former, and the second half for the latter. Well, we only have three words for China Mobile: hurry up already!</p><p> </p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/china-mobile-says-over-60-million-td-scdma-devices-sold-in-2012-aiming-for-twice-as-many-this-year/">China Mobile says over 60 million TD-SCDMA devices sold in 2012, aiming for twice as many this year</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/china-mobile-says-over-60-million-td-scdma-devices-sold-in-2012-aiming-for-twice-as-many-this-year/5589690"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/china-mobile-qcom-2013-01-23_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/china-mobile-says-over-60-million-td-scdma-devices-sold-in-2012-aiming-for-twice-as-many-this-year/5589684"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/china-mobile-qcom-2013-01-23-1_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/china-mobile-says-over-60-million-td-scdma-devices-sold-in-2012-aiming-for-twice-as-many-this-year/5589685"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/china-mobile-qcom-2013-01-23-2_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/china-mobile-says-over-60-million-td-scdma-devices-sold-in-2012-aiming-for-twice-as-many-this-year/5589686"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/china-mobile-qcom-2013-01-23-3_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/china-mobile-says-over-60-million-td-scdma-devices-sold-in-2012-aiming-for-twice-as-many-this-year/5589687"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/china-mobile-qcom-2013-01-23-4_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/" rel="tag">Wireless</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/china-mobile-td-scdma-2013/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"2ef255a476d46617609e72da05ca9da4";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:65:"Russell Crowe to Do Double Duty as Australian Academy Awards Host";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/lEX1xGDc6OI/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:11:"Pip Bulbeck";s:4:"date";i:1358918826;s:7:"content";s:2651:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2011/06/russell_crowe_three_days_2011_a_p.jpg"><br>Crowe will host the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts International awards in Los Angeles on Saturday, then the main Australian awards in Sydney next week.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-miserables-star-russell-crowe-414705" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27cd21b5/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Russell+Crowe+to+Do+Double+Duty+as+Australian+Academy+Awards+Host&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fles-miserables-star-russell-crowe-414705" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Russell+Crowe+to+Do+Double+Duty+as+Australian+Academy+Awards+Host&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fles-miserables-star-russell-crowe-414705" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

If recent testing is any indicator, a Verizon edition might be in the cards. An LG VS870 (the Escape is the P870) has appeared at the FCC wielding support for Verizon's CDMA and LTE networks.

How else it might change from the 4.3-inch Escape, if it's indeed similar, isn't visible.

Today, Sony's doing its part to make its products more appealing by adding two new lenses (for a total of 13): a 20mm f/2.8 pancake and a 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 OSS powered-zoom optic, which first made its debut with the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/12/sony-nex-vg30-vg900-hands-on/">VG30 camcorder</a>, but will now be available as a standalone purchase. That first model will ship in April for $350, while the zoom lens will be available in March for $1,200. Photography buffs can catch a few more details in the PR just past the break.</p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <strong>Sony Expands Lens Lineup for &alpha; E-Mount Camera System with New Wide-Angle and Telephoto Models</strong></p>  <p>   New 20mm f/2.8 "pancake" lens and Video-friendly 18-200mm f/3.5 - f/6.3 "Power Zoom" lens extend creative possibilities</p>  <p>   SAN DIEGO, Jan. 22, 2013 - Sony is expanding its popular E-mount camera system with the addition of two new lenses compatible with all &alpha; E-Mount cameras and semi-professional camcorders.</p>  <p>   New 20mm F2.8 'pancake' wide angle lens (model SEL20F28)</p>  <p>   When mounted on any Sony &alpha; E-Mount camera, the sharp new SEL20F28 "pancake" lens creates an exceptionally versatile, portable package ideal for a broad range of everyday shooting opportunities ranging from interiors to landscapes, street photography, casual snapshots and more.</p>  <p>   The new lens features an ultra-slim design approximately 20mm from lens front to back, and with its wide angle of view (30mm on 35mm equivalent) and bright F2.8 aperture, it produces excellent contrast, resolution and clarity across the frame for both still image and full HD video shooting.</p>  <p>   New 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS Powered Telephoto Zoom Lens (model SELP18200)</p>  <p>   Originally offered only as a kit lens for the new NEX-VG30 camcorder introduced this past fall, the new SELP18200 powered telephoto zoom lens will now be available for purchase as a stand-alone lens.</p>  <p>   Designed for serious videographers, the high-quality lens offers a generous 11x magnification range and whisper-quiet power zoom mechanics, focusing and aperture operation. This allows for smooth cinematic transitions when adjusting zoom level or manual settings during shooting. It features a comfortably positioned zoom lever that works with a switch on the lens barrel, allowing zoom speed to be selected in three different steps - from slow, beautiful shifts in perspective to dramatic crash-zoom effects. Zoom can also be controlled directly from compatible NEX-VG900, NEX-VG30 and NEX-FS700 (requires firmware update) video cameras.</p>  <p>   The new lens also has built-in Optical SteadyShot[TM], which cuts the effects of camera shake and minimizes camera blur while shooting handheld at slower shutter speeds. Additionally, Active Mode further enhances stabilization at the wide end of the 11x zoom range ensuring smooth, stable footage even if the shooter is in motion. While the new SELP18200 lens is optimized for video, it's also a flexible choice for shooting still photography - from expansive landscapes to high impact close-ups of wildlife or athletes - with Sony's &alpha; E-Mount range of interchangeable lens still cameras.</p>  <p>   Sony &alpha; E-mount lens family expansion</p>  <p>   These new models expand the Sony E-mount family to 13 native E-mount lenses plus two converters, covering virtually any shooting situation for photographers and videographers alike. Spanning ultra-wide angle, powerful telezoom, macro and fast, bright primes, the range includes premium optics by Sony and Carl Zeiss, and offers refined performance and easy handling throughout the line.</p>  <p>   Pricing and Availability</p>  <p>   The new E 20mm F2.8 (SEL20F28) wide-angle prime lens will be available this April for about $350.</p>  <p>   The new E PZ18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS (SELP18200) motorized telezoom lens will be available this March for about $1200.</p>  <p>   The Sony &alpha;

The 2.0 version of the ReWalk's Rehabilitation model made its debut today, sporting a new Rapid Exchange slider that makes it easier to size the device to fit wearers in the physical rehabilitation settings for which it was built, making it easier to use the device with a number of different patients. Also new is the Beginner Gait Mode -- revamped software aimed to soften the learning curve for those new to the device. The Rehabilitation is one of two ReWalk models offered up by the company. Its counterpart, the ReWalk Personal, is, as its name implies, intended for home usage. That model is currently awaiting FDA approval here in the States. More info on the new exoskeleton can be found after the break in the form of a handy press release.</p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <em><strong>ARGO Medical Technologies Unveils Advancement of its Exoskeleton Technology with Launch of ReWalk Rehabilitation 2.0</strong></em></p>  <p>   <em>ARGO Medical Technologies has unveiled the newest generation of its ReWalk Rehabilitation exoskeleton that enables individuals with spinal cord injuries the ability to walk again. The 2.0 system is designed to make it easier to treat multiple individuals each day, it also has new software features that support beginner users and new sizing that allows each system to fit a broader range of patients.</em></p>  <p>   <em>ReWalk Rehabilitation 2.0 Highlights:</em></p>  <p>   <em>&middot; Rapid Exchange: A new slider adjustment mechanism accelerates and simplifies the process of sizing for individual users with a new sizing scale and a simple "click" that indicates the alignment of joints.</em></p>  <p>   <em>&middot; Universal Sizing: The new model fits a wide range of heights in just one device. Clinicians can easily adjust the unit to fit users between 160cm -190cm in height.</em></p>  <p>   <em>&middot; Beginner Gait Mode: Newly enhanced software has improved the learning process to support and transition new users as they learn to take their first steps in the ReWalk.</em></p>  <p>   <em>"I am very excited to launch this new generation of exoskeleton technology. We have learned from the everyday use by clinicians and the experience of their patients and believe as a company it is essential we continue to enhance this technology to meet the needs of those working with it." said Larry Jasinski, ARGO CEO. "The ReWalk Rehabilitation 2.0 offers an experience that is very close to natural walking and this new model will improve the learning curve to allow ReWalkers to quickly gain comfort as they begin to walk independently."</em></p>  <p>   <em>ARGO currently offers two ReWalk models - the ReWalk Personal, currently available in Europe and pending FDA review in the US; and the ReWalk Rehabilitation which is now available in Europe, Israel and the United States. Both models are designed to provide a customized user experience with on-board computers and motion sensors that restore self-initiated walking without needing tethers or switches to begin movement. The ReWalk uses patented technology with motorized legs that power knee and hip movement. It controls movement using subtle changes in center of gravity, mimics natural gait and provides functional walking speed. A forward tilt of the upper body is sensed by the system, which triggers the first step. Repeated body shifting generates a sequence of steps, which allows natural and efficient walking.</em></p>  <p>   <em>"Training in the ReWalk has changed my life in a way I did not believe possible after I became paralyzed," said Sgt. Theresa Hannigan, U.S. Army Retired and ReWalk user. "When I use the ReWalk I regain my independence; I have been able to walk a 1 mile road race, and stand up hug my friends and family."</em></p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/" rel="tag">Wearables</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/alt/" rel="tag">Alt</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/argo-rewalk/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"d2794d543ab2511acfb9feb05765ead4";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:80:"Shawn Ryan's 'Beverly Hills Cop,' Hart Hanson Crime Drama Among CBS Pilot Orders";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/QS0-OFsOgwQ/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:28:"Lesley Goldberg , Lacey Rose";s:4:"date";i:1358906923;s:7:"content";s:2686:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2012/10/brandon_t_jackson_eddie_murphy.jpg"><br>The network also picks up a comedy from "Friends" producer Dana Klein and Aaron Kaplan.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/beverly-hills-cop-shawn-ryan-eddie-murphy-hart-hanson-414654" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27cc6827/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Shawn+Ryan%27s+%27Beverly+Hills+Cop%2C%27+Hart+Hanson+Crime+Drama+Among+CBS+Pilot+Orders&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fbeverly-hills-cop-shawn-ryan-eddie-murphy-hart-hanson-414654" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Shawn+Ryan%27s+%27Beverly+Hills+Cop%2C%27+Hart+Hanson+Crime+Drama+Among+CBS+Pilot+Orders&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fbeverly-hills-cop-shawn-ryan-eddie-murphy-hart-hanson-414654" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

According to Page and Co., developers just have to add a new file extension to their app, tweak a manifest file and get ahold of the fresh SDK. ARM support is reason enough for developers to celebrate, but Google says it's working on a next-gen Portable Native Client that'll let apps work regardless of architecture and without having to recompile, to boot.

It looks like the agency has been making some steady progress since then, though, and has today released a new video showing some of the work it's done up through November of last year. As you can see after the break, that work is all still being doing in the lab, but it covers quite a few of the components that DARPA ultimately hopes to use in space, including robotic arms and gripping mechanisms. Those tests will remain Earth-bound for the next few years, but a demonstration mission is slated for 2016 to see how the system fares on an actual satellite in orbit. </p><p> </p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/science/" rel="tag">Science</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/alt/" rel="tag">Alt</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/darpa-touts-progress-on-phoenix-program-to-salvage-dead-satellit/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://phys.org/news/2013-01-military-life-dead-satellites.html">PhysOrg</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2013/01/22a.aspx">DARPA</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"1255e05da4c05820fa4295ea789a8ce1";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:92:"Sundance 2013: Paul Rudd on 'Prince Avalanche' and the David Gordon Green Experience (Video)";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/dIMKonxzxTA/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:19:"Sophie A.

Music lovers everywhere can stop carrying multiple portable audio devices in order to enjoy the high definition, studio-quality sound from Astell&amp;Kern's AK100.<br><br>   The new upgrade allows users to play both new high definition audio and their current collection of digital music, all with one player.<br><br>   The Astell&amp;Kern player is the first portable hi-fi audio device from iriver, capable of Mastering Quality Sound (MQS) playback. MQS files are sound or music files saved as a lossless format, straight from the studio mastering source. Because less data is lost during the digital mastering process and the sound quality is distortion-free, a dramatic difference from the 24bit source data from MQS files and CD (WAV)/MP3s can be heard and felt. MQS files are often in 24bit WAV or FLAC formats. With the encoding process in the AK100 MQS Portable System, MQS music and sounds are more refined and pure.<br><br>   Henry Park, CEO of iriver, says, "We are very pleased that the addition of AAC, ALAC, and AIFF codecs makes the Astell&amp;Kern portable audio player the only music unit anyone will ever need. Music lovers finally get the quality of the music they have been longing for, yet can access their entire collection in one unit. We think that is pretty awesome."<br><br>   The Astell&amp;Kern is the world's first portable audio device equipped with the Wolfson WM8740 Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). It contains 32GB of internal memory and can be expanded via two (2) microSD card slots, each supporting an additional 32GB microSD card. The Astell&amp;Kern is compatible with FLAC, WAV, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC and AIFF audio files. Its 2,000 mAH battery provides up to 16 hours of playback on a single charge. The Astell&amp;Kern offers numerous connection options, including micro-USB, optical in/out and headphone out.<br><br>   Iriver has partnered with HDtracks to provide users with albums encoded with Mastering Quality Sound. HDtracks is a high-quality music download service offering an exciting catalog of Mastering Quality music from every major label across all genres. They have several formats available for fans of all types of music. If you would like genuine CD-quality sound, HDtracks offers both AIFF and FLAC lossless files. For those who wish to carry their music in a portable mp3 player, they have 320kbps files that far exceed the quality of standard MP3 files. For audiophiles, HDtracks has a large catalog of ultra-high resolution 96kHz/24bit and 192kHz/24-bit titles from legendary rock, jazz, and classical artists as well as emerging artists. This is true DVD-audio sound quality for music lovers that demand the very best!<br><br>   The AK100 is $699 and is available at high-end audio stores and online at Amazon.com, Buy.com, ebay.com and www.iriverinc.com.</p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/portable-audio-video/" rel="tag">Portable Audio/Video</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/iriver-ak100-apple-based-audio-codecs/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iriver.com/company/notice_view.asp?sno=58&amp;irTop=0">iriver</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"35452dc50e6c034c67db66ee24e46f83";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:72:"Lego Lens Cap Holder Hack Brilliantly Merges Your Old Toys With Your New";s:4:"link";s:127:"http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/06jot_grHU0/lego-lens-cap-holder-hack-brilliantly-merges-your-old-toys-with-your-new";s:6:"author";s:16:"Andrew Liszewski";s:4:"date";i:1358893200;s:7:"content";s:2378:"<div> <!-- div style="background-color: #B3B3B3; width: 190px; padding: 1px;"><a title="Click here to read Lego Lens Cap Holder Hack Brilliantly Merges Your Old Toys With Your New" href="http://gizmodo.com/photography/" style="background-color:#888888; color:#FFFFFF; font-size:12px;text-align:right; display:block; height:14px; padding:1px 2px; text-decoration:none; text-transform:uppercase; width:156px;"><span style="color: white;" class="hash">#</span><span style="color: white;">photography</span></a></div --> <div><a title="Click here to read Lego Lens Cap Holder Hack Brilliantly Merges Your Old Toys With Your New" href="http://gizmodo.com/5978060/lego-lens-cap-holder-hack-brilliantly-merges-your-old-toys-with-your-new"> <img height="360" width="640" title="Click here to read Lego Lens Cap Holder Hack Brilliantly Merges Your Old Toys With Your New" alt="Click here to read Lego Lens Cap Holder Hack Brilliantly Merges Your Old Toys With Your New" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18cazgzw9lfc9jpg/xlarge.jpg"></a></div> </div> How do you keep track of your camera's lens cap when you're shooting?

For Q4, the company posted revenue of $1.16 billion, which is a 32-percent drop from the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/24/amd-q4-2011-earnings/">same period in 2011</a>, netting a loss of 63 cents per share. For 2012 as a whole, the company's revenue rang in at $5.42 billion -- a 17-percent fall from the previous year, and a $1.60 loss per share. President Rory Read references evolution and diversification when discussing outlook, but it's clear that the company needs to make some major adjustments before it can return to profitability. Let's hope that AMD's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/10/amd-temash-reference-laptop-hands-on/">2013 lineup</a>, including the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/amd-temash-kabini-richland-kaveri-apu/">Temash and Kabini APUs</a>, help to turn this company around.

The internet giant just announced its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012, and unsurprisingly it's still raking in the dough. For the three month period ending December 31st, 2012 the company pulled in $14.42 billion in revenue -- a staggering 36 percent increase <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/19/googles-q4-net-revenue-totals-8-13-billion-wall-street-disapp/">year-over-year</a>. That doesn't even include revenue generated by Motorola's recently spun off Home division, which would have pushed the total to $15.24 billion. 2012 also marked the first year that the company broke the $50 billion barrier for total revenues. Of course, bringing in all that money means nothing if you can't actually turn a profit. Good news for investors is that Google saw a net income of $2.89 billion this quarter, up from $2.71 billion the same time last year and $2.74 billion <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/18/google-q3-2012-earnings-report/">last quarter</a>. Not surprisingly, a large chunk of that cash is coming from Google's own properties and advertising -- with Google-owned sites accounting for 67 percent of revenues and ads pulling in $12 billion on their own.</p><p> <span>Obviously, a vast majority of Big G's income is coming from the US, $5.99 billion in this quarter, but international markets are still hugely important for the company. 53 percent of its revenues came from overseas ventures, including $1.3 billion from the UK alone.</span></p><p> Motorola Mobility, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/27/motorola-mobility-reports-3-3-billion-in-revenue-and-32-millio/">isn't faring so well</a>. While pulling in $1.51 billion in revenue, the phone manufacturer lost $353 million as its new parent company continues to try to turn around the business. Whether or not Mountain View is succeeding is debatable as revenues continue to drop and losses increase for the beleaguered, former icon. There is a sizable war chest at its disposal however, as Google claims to have $48.1 billion in cash or its equivalent on hand.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Results</strong></p>  <p>   Google Inc. reported consolidated revenues of $14.42 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2012. Consolidated revenues would have been $15.24 billion had Motorola Home been included.</p>  <p>   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - January 22, 2013 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.</p>  <p>   "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter," said Larry Page, CEO of Google. "Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year - not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half. In today's multi-screen world we face tremendous opportunities as a technology company focused on user benefit. It's an incredibly exciting time to be at Google."</p>  <p>   Q4 Financial Summary</p>  <p>   In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group, Inc. and certain other persons to dispose the Motorola Home business for a total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2013. As a result, financial results related to the Home business are presented as net loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income, and are excluded from all other results unless otherwise noted. Assets and liabilities of the Home business are not presented separately because they are not material.</p>  <p>   Google Inc. reported consolidated revenues of $14.42 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Google Inc. reports advertising revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs (TAC). In the fourth quarter of 2012, TAC totaled $3.08 billion, or 25% of advertising revenues.</p>  <p>   Operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) are reported on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures at the end of this release.</p>  <p>   GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $3.39 billion, or 24% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $3.51 billion, or 33% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $4.27 billion, or 30% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $4.04 billion, or 38% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2011. Had we included Home, non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 would have been $4.31 billion.<br>   GAAP net income including net loss from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $2.89 billion, compared to $2.71 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $3.57 billion, compared to $3.13 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011.<br>   GAAP EPS including impact from net loss from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $8.62 on 335 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $8.22 in the fourth quarter of 2011 on 329 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $10.65, compared to $9.50 in the fourth quarter of 2011.<br>   Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin exclude stock-based compensation (SBC) expense, as well as restructuring and related charges recorded in our Motorola Mobile business. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the expenses noted above, net of the related tax benefits, as well as net loss from discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the expense related to SBC and the related tax benefits were $700 million and $152 million compared to $536 million and $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2012, restructuring and related charges recorded in our Motorola Mobile business were $178 million, and the related tax benefits were $65 million. In addition, net loss from discontinued operations, in the fourth quarter of 2012, was $21 million. In the fourth quarter of 2012, non-GAAP operating income with Home included the impact from Home of $35 million and excludes the above SBC expense and restructuring and related charges.<br>   Q4 Financial Highlights</p>  <p>   Revenues and other information - On a consolidated basis, Google Inc. revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 was $14.42 billion, an increase of 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>  <p>   Google Revenues (advertising and other) - Google revenues were $12.91 billion, or 89% of consolidated revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2012, representing a 22% increase over fourth quarter 2011 revenues of $10.58 billion.<br>   Google Sites Revenues - Google-owned sites generated revenues of $8.64 billion, or 67% of total Google revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2012.

A stat chart culled from The NPD Group's, "<span>Connected Intelligence Report, Application &amp; Convergence" revealed the latest US-centric news on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix">Netflix Instant</a> usage; it puts HDTV use far above that of more traditional platforms like PCs and laptops. Averaged across age groups, 40 percent of people using Netflix Instant in the US are doing so on HDTVs, while just 14 percent are going through computers (both desktops and laptops). That's not just Smart TVs, but also, "another device connected to the TV" -- so that's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/04/sony-playstation-3-netflix-streaming/">game consoles</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/roku">streaming boxes</a>, <em>and</em> software level built-in streaming.</span></p><p> <span>A mere 13 percent are using the service on tablets, and a paltry 8 percent are streaming on smartphones (a stat David Lynch would <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcNLEwf2pOw">assuredly relish</a>). Unsurprisingly, users are primarily of the younger variety: over 50 percent of 18 to 25-year-olds make up the HDTV statistic, and that group makes up nearly a full quarter of PC folks. Of course, none of this is a huge surprise to anyone that's ever tried comfortably watching anything longer than a few minutes on a 13-inch laptop screen.

But, as of today, the two companies are looking to take things even further by building upon the work started with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/31/bing-search-lets-you-tag-facebook-friends-forces-them-to-google/">Bing Tags</a> last summer. The integration, which previously allowed users to tag themselves or Facebook friends on sites and search queries for more personal feedback, will now extend beyond a user's inner circle and be made available to a "broader audience."  Of course, privacy here is key (as we also learned from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/15/facebook-2013-press-event-liveblog/">Facebook's last press event</a>) and Microsoft's making it abundantly clear that this is <em>opt-in</em>.  So, unless you give explicit approval for your tags to appear out-of-network, they won't -- only your friends will have access to those results. If you haven't already signed-up for the beta service, you can test it out at the source below.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/" rel="tag">Internet</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/microsoft/" rel="tag">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/facebook/" rel="tag">Facebook</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/bing-tags-public-results-facebook/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/01/22/microsoft-expands-bing-tags-beyond-facebook-lets-you-publicly-tag-friends-on-blogs-twitter-more/" target="_blank">TheNextWeb</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2013/01/22/make-a-great-impression-with-bing-tags.aspx" target="_blank">Bing</a><!--//-->, <a href="http://www.bing.com/tags/learn?form=BMPREV" target="_blank">(2)</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"c11628a2d67b467c7672be3b7220dacb";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:90:"Crackle streaming video heads to LG, Samsung, and Vizio Smart TVs, Samsung Blu-ray players";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/crackle-lg-samsung-vizio/";s:6:"author";s:11:"Ben Gilbert";s:4:"date";i:1358881980;s:7:"content";s:6638:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/crackle-lg-samsung-vizio/"><img alt="Crackle video service heads LG, Samsung, and Vizio Smart TVs, Samsung Bluray players" data-src-height="340" data-src-width="620" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/viziocracklehedimg620x340px.jpg"></a></p><p> Free video streaming service <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/crackle">Crackle</a> is already available on your <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/20/crackle-for-ios-brings-free-movies-and-tv-shows-to-ipads-iphone/">smart phone</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/16/sony-kills-grouper-say-hello-to-crackle/">computer</a>, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/29/crackle-starts-streaming-free-movies-to-roku-ps3-sony-tvs-and/">game console</a>, but today the company announced its expansion to LG, Samsung, and Vizio Smart TVs.

That film is apparently being adapted for the little screen -- well, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/27/westinghouse-4k-tvs-at-ces/">perhaps not <em>so</em> little</a>, but <em>littler</em> -- by none other than <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/20/amazon-studios-six-original-comedy-series-pilot-production/">Amazon Studios</a>, the in-house team created to produce original content on Amazon's Instant streaming service, reports <em>Broadcast Now</em>. It's not clear just how far along the series is, but <em>io9</em> did discover some casting pages which reveal the plot: "the show will center around the original group of post apocalyptic survivors." Presumably that means more Twinkie references, more awkward romance, and a ton more comical zombie killing. That is, of course, if the early casting sheets are indicative of what the final show ends up being. Regardless, we've reached out to Amazon for more info, and we've dropped some of the film's best parts just below the break.</p><div> </div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/misc/" rel="tag">Misc</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/" rel="tag">Home Entertainment</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/hd/" rel="tag">HD</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/amazon/" rel="tag">Amazon</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/zombieland-tv-show-amazon-instant/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3900764/amazon-developing-zombieland-original-series">The Verge</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/international/amazon-develops-zombieland-remake/5050884.article">Broadcast Now</a><!--//-->, <a target="_blank" href="http://io9.com/5977733/the-zombieland-tv-show-heads-to-amazoncom">io9</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"9a0a2690c63101c9dd312540ca9c5881";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:54:"Which is the best Windows Phone 8 device?

Today, the volume of those rumors has gotten louder. Both <em>CNBC</em> and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report that Microsoft is looking to help buy out the PC maker, paying a grand chunk -- between $1 and $3 billion -- of the price to buy out Dell's publicly-owned shares. According to <em>Reuters'</em> sources, Michael Dell and friends have formed a committee to evaluate any such deals or offers, but naturally, any other details about Microsoft's (or anyone else's) involvement are few and far between. We've reached out to both Dell and Microsoft for comment, and we'll update our post here as we learn more.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/desktops/" rel="tag">Desktops</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/laptops/" rel="tag">Laptops</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/microsoft/" rel="tag">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/dell/" rel="tag">Dell</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/dell-microsoft-buyout-private/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/22/us-microsoft-dell-idUSBRE90L0O920130122">Reuters</a><!--//-->, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100397621">CNBC</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"4055c8543e2b4d7a47d92099ac00380e";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:82:"Kantar: Apple's smartphone OS still the top selling in US for last quarter of 2012";s:4:"link";s:46:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/kantar-ios/";s:6:"author";s:12:"Brian Heater";s:4:"date";i:1358875920;s:7:"content";s:1974:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/kantar-ios/"><img alt="" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/iphone-5-2012-09-14-600-18.jpg"></a></p><p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Kantar/">Kantar's</a> numbers for the final quarter of last year are in, and things are <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/21/kantar-iphone-5-boosts-apples-us-smartphone-share-to-53-3-perc/">still looking peachy</a> for Apple in the US smartphone market.

The second and third place entrants are the same as well, with Android at 44.4-percent and Microsoft's mobile version of Windows at 2.6-percent sales. On the carrier side, AT&amp;T scored exactly a third of smartphone sales, with Verizon close before at 32-percent, according to to Kantar's numbers.

Microsoft just announced that its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/microsoft-surface-pro-hands-on/">Surface Pro</a> tablet will go on sale February 9th in the US and Canada, with wide retail availability beyond just Microsoft.com and Microsoft Stores. As you may have already read, the device will start at $899 for the 64GB model, and $999 for the 128GB version. Whichever you choose, a pressure-sensitive pen comes in the box; the keyboard does not (that'll be $120 or $130, depending on whether you get the Touch or Type Cover).</p><p> Also on February 9th, Microsoft is going to start offering a 64GB standalone version of Surface for Windows RT for $599 (the 64GB model is currently sold as part of a $699 bundle with the black Touch Cover). That's good news, we suppose, for folks who prefer the tactile feel of the Type keyboard. Or, you know, who have their heart set on cyan. Additionally, Surface RT will soon be available in 13 more markets: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. All told, that more than doubles the number of a countries where the Surface RT is sold. So, Western Europe should pretty much be set now.</p><p> Finally, in addition to those two tablets, Microsoft is introducing a bunch of accessories, also slated to land February 9th. These include three limited edition Touch Covers with funky patterns drawn on (we don't know about you, but we especially dig the skulls). It's not unlike the way Microsoft already sells artsy versions of its computer mice; indeed, a Microsoft rep told us the company intends to release even more special editions, the same way it keeps swapping in new mouse colors. Finally, Microsoft also announced the Wedge Touch Mouse Surface Edition, which is basically the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/30/microsoft-wedge-mobile-keyboard-wedge-touch-mouse/">regular Wedge mouse</a>, just done up in the same finish as the Surface tablets. That will cost $70, while the limited edition keyboards are priced at $130 a pop. Hopefully we'll be hitting you back soon with a full review but for now, we've got shots of both the tablet and the new accessories waiting just past the break.</p><p> </p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/surface-pro-limited-edition-touch-covers-and-the-wedge-touch-mouse-surface-edition/">Surface Pro, limited edition Touch Covers and the Wedge Touch Mouse Surface Edition</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/surface-pro-limited-edition-touch-covers-and-the-wedge-touch-mouse-surface-edition/5587019"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/surface031typecover_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/surface-pro-limited-edition-touch-covers-and-the-wedge-touch-mouse-surface-edition/5587020"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/surface037_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/surface-pro-limited-edition-touch-covers-and-the-wedge-touch-mouse-surface-edition/5587021"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/surface046_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/surface-pro-limited-edition-touch-covers-and-the-wedge-touch-mouse-surface-edition/5587022"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/surface095_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/surface-pro-limited-edition-touch-covers-and-the-wedge-touch-mouse-surface-edition/5587023"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/surfaceproleft_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   Microsoft Grows Surface Family<br>   Announces Surface Windows 8 Pro availability, market expansion and new accessories.</p>  <p>   REDMOND, Wash. - Jan. 22, 2013 - Microsoft Corp. today announced that its Surface family of PCs is growing.

The debate about it centers on how best to compress video: the widely used industry-standard H.264 codec, or Google's royalty-free, open-source VP8 codec? </p><p> The discussion took some surprising twists and turns late last year -- including Google's last-minute action to postpone discussion because of unspecified intellectual property issues and a vote by H.264 patent holders about whether to offer that codec for free. </p><p> If this debate sounds familiar, it's because Web standards setters already hashed it in recent years when dealing with Web video. There, fans of H.264's quality and widespread support pitted against those who gnash their teeth at patent-encumbered technology erecting toll booths on an an Internet otherwise built from free-to-implement standards. </p><p> HTML5 introduced built-in video, in principle letting Web developers use it as easily as they do images and no longer requiring them to rely on a plug-in like Adobe Systems' Flash Player. </p> <h3>Related stories</h3> <ul><li>... <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57565090-93/video-showdown-set-for-march-in-web-chat-debate/?part=rss&amp;subj=cnet&amp;tag=readMore">[Read more]</a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://cnet.com.feedsportal.com/c/34938/f/645450/s/27c9105c/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884698576/u/49/f/645450/c/34938/s/27c9105c/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884698576/u/49/f/645450/c/34938/s/27c9105c/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884698576/u/49/f/645450/c/34938/s/27c9105c/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/cnet/NnTv/~4/e5a8OgHO6sk" height="1" width="1"></li></ul>";s:9:"feed_link";s:16:"http://cnet.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:4:"CNET";}s:32:"4b7244c8e1c1b0f66de10af42d4a26d1";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:62:"Apple's Chinese New Year sale hits Jan. 25 -- but only in Asia";s:4:"link";s:56:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/NnTv/~3/_WC6HxhCwN0/";s:6:"author";s:12:"Shara Tibken";s:4:"date";i:1358872632;s:7:"content";s:2602:"<div><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57565150-37/apples-chinese-new-year-sale-hits-jan-25-but-only-in-asia/?part=rss&amp;subj=cnet&amp;tag=image"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="1" src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2013/01/22/2013-oneday-landing-teaser-hero%3Fwid%3D1025%26amp%3Bhei%3D681%26amp%3Bfmt%3Dpng-alpha%26amp%3Bqlt%3D95_700x500.png" alt=""></a></div> <p>Apple will hold a Chinese New Year sale Friday in Asia.</p> <span> (Credit: Screenshot by Shara Tibken/CNET) </span> Apple will<a href="http://store.apple.com/sg/browse/new_year/red_friday"> kick off its Chinese New Year sale Friday</a>, giving customers in the key Asia market access to discounts as part of its effort to attract buyers in the fast-growing region.<p> The sale will last from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Jan. 25 and will take place in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan.</p><p> </p><h3>Related stories:</h3> <ul><li><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57564277-37/apple-offers-installment-payments-to-customers-in-china/?part=rss&amp;subj=cnet&amp;tag=embed">Apple offers installment payments to customers in China</a></li> <li><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57564658-37/ipad-mini-cellular-model-debuts-in-china-with-two-week-delay/?part=rss&amp;subj=cnet&amp;tag=embed">iPad Mini cellular model debuts in China with two-week delay</a></li> <li><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57561156-37/ipad-mini-in-hot-demand-in-china-analyst/?part=rss&amp;subj=cnet&amp;tag=embed">iPad Mini in hot demand in China -- analyst</a></li> </ul> Apple already has introduced a <a href="http://store.apple.com/hk/browse/new_year/guide">Chinese New Year gift guide,</a> but it's unclear what discounts it will offer Friday.

Tapscott points out that the first wave of e-government simply automated existing processes and moved existing government... <a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57565009-285/how-to-participate-in-the-open-government-movement/?part=rss&amp;subj=cnet&amp;tag=readMore">[Read more]</a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://cnet.com.feedsportal.com/c/34938/f/645450/s/27c90cc7/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884698018/u/49/f/645450/c/34938/s/27c90cc7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884698018/u/49/f/645450/c/34938/s/27c90cc7/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884698018/u/49/f/645450/c/34938/s/27c90cc7/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/cnet/NnTv/~4/m0sSAdQDEo4" height="1" width="1"></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:16:"http://cnet.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:4:"CNET";}s:32:"0c20b6d690b668e16d0fe9c5f54fad08";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:70:"EE adds 20GB plan for 4G power users, pricing starts at £46 per month";s:4:"link";s:53:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/ee-adds-20gb-plan/";s:6:"author";s:10:"Zach Honig";s:4:"date";i:1358872080;s:7:"content";s:5362:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/ee-adds-20gb-plan/"><img alt="" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/10/eepricing.jpg"></a></p><p> Want to take advantage of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/ee-lte-speed-test-4g/">blazing-fast LTE speeds</a> in the UK? You better be prepared to drop a few dozen quid, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/22/ee-details-uk-4g-pricing/">each and every month</a>. The nation's only LTE provider is clearly taking advantage of that exclusivity with gigantic tariffs, like &pound;31 (about $50) per month for 3 gigs of SIM-only data (and "unlimited minutes and texts"). If you speed a <em>lot</em> of time pulling down content on your mobile, though, a new 20GB plan makes the carrier's pricing structure a bit easier to swallow. Customers who sign up for the new 12-month "super-user" plan between now and February 28th will pay &pound;46 (about $73), while a smaller-cap 8GB offering will be available for &pound;41 (about $65) each month. Keep in mind that these are SIM-only tariffs -- you'll pay much more if bundling in a smartphone subsidy. Still, if you have a need for mega bandwidth for home use or on the go, the price per gig of this new plan makes EE seem a bit more reasonable.

London. EE, the UK's most advanced digital communications company, today announced a range of new 4GEE promotional price plans. The new packages are designed to provide consumers with an even greater choice of 4G options to suit their needs.<br><br>   As a special promotion from 31 January until 31 March, a range of entry-level 4GEE plans is being introduced. For only &pound;31 per month on a 24 month plan, customers receive unlimited UK calls and texts, and 500MB of mobile data, as well as the option to choose from a range of 4G smartphones for a one off fee such as the HTC One SV LTE or Nokia Lumia 820 which are available from just &pound;29.99 (a saving of &pound;90 on existing EE deals). Customers on 24 month plans can also take their unlimited calls and texts abroad with them to select destinations for just &pound;5 more per month1 while those looking for flexibility can get a 12 month plan for only &pound;41 per month.<br><br>   Additionally, after listening to customers, EE will be launching a new plan offering 20GB of mobile data. The plan addresses a small number of 'super-users' (currently fewer than 1% of 4G customers), who have shown a desire to use more than the 8G of mobile data that is currently available on EE's largest 4GEE plan. The 20GB plan, which is rolling out across retail channels from today, will be available on a 12 month SIM-only plan at a special rate of &pound;46 per month for the full length of the plan if they sign-up between now and the 28 February2. The bundle comes with unlimited UK calls and texts and is also available with the very latest 4G handsets for &pound;61 per month on a 24 month plan to customers who sign-up by 28 February3 . EE is also introducing a new SIM-Only 12 month 8GB plan for &pound;41 per month.<br><br>   Pippa Dunn, Chief Marketing Officer at EE, said: "It's our aim to offer consumers the most comprehensive range of 4GEE price plans. With these new options we're looking to not only make 4G smartphones even more accessible, but offer even greater value for the small number of super-users out there - ensuring EE really does offer a package that's tailored for all customers 4G needs."<br><br>   EE's superfast 4G offers a revolutionary mobile internet experience, delivering speeds typically five times faster than 3G4. The power of 4G enables tablet users to push the limits of their devices even further, allowing them to download, stream and browse the content they want, even quicker than before. In addition to superfast speeds, EE customers will also benefit from:</p>  <p>   &middot; EE Film - the UK film service that combines 2 for 1 cinema ticketing, listings, trailers, film downloads and streaming in one place<br><br>   &middot; EE Wi-Fi - access to millions of wireless hotspots across the UK, at no extra cost<br><br>   &middot; Discounted superfast EE fibre broadband - so they can enjoy blistering speeds at home and on the move<br><br>   EE's 4G service will be available in 35 towns and cities by the end of March 2013, bringing superfast speeds to even more consumers and businesses across the UK.<br><br>   Full details on the new promotional plans, including terms and conditions, will be available shortly in EE shops as well as on www.ee.co.uk</p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/ee-adds-20gb-plan/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://explore.ee.co.uk/our-company/newsroom/ee-announces-new-superfast-4gee-price-plan-offers">EE</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"f31e600c1a283d10d7526d77ece178ac";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:66:"Internet Explorer vs Murder Rate Will Be Your Favorite Chart Today";s:4:"link";s:121:"http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/uZPlLhjV3n4/internet-explorer-vs-murder-rate-will-be-your-favorite-chart-today";s:6:"author";s:10:"Jesus Diaz";s:4:"date";i:1358871420;s:7:"content";s:2009:"<div> <!-- div style="background-color: #B3B3B3; width: 190px; padding: 1px;"><a title="Click here to read Internet Explorer vs Murder Rate Will Be Your Favorite Chart Today" href="http://gizmodo.com/chart/" style="background-color:#888888; color:#FFFFFF; font-size:12px;text-align:right; display:block; height:14px; padding:1px 2px; text-decoration:none; text-transform:uppercase; width:156px;"><span style="color: white;" class="hash">#</span><span style="color: white;">chart</span></a></div --> <div><a title="Click here to read Internet Explorer vs Murder Rate Will Be Your Favorite Chart Today" href="http://gizmodo.com/5977989/internet-explorer-vs-murder-rate-will-be-your-favorite-chart-today"> <img height="360" width="640" title="Click here to read Internet Explorer vs Murder Rate Will Be Your Favorite Chart Today" alt="Click here to read Internet Explorer vs Murder Rate Will Be Your Favorite Chart Today" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18camj2qheoagjpg/xlarge.jpg"></a></div> </div> Like its author says " I know correlation doesn't imply causation but..."

Audojo is hoping to change this with an iPad gaming case which is launching today on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Kickstarter/">Kickstarter</a>. The accessory works with any iPad 2 or newer, and features a pair of analog joysticks, two shoulder buttons and stereo speakers. Unlike other mobile game controllers like <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/11/ifrogz-caliber-advantage-iphone-gaming-case-hands-on/">iFrogz's Caliber Advantage</a> or <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/31/powera-unveils-moga-bluetooth-controller-for-android-devices-we/">PowerA's Moga</a> / <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/10/moga-pro-hands-on/">Moga Pro</a>, Audojo skips Bluetooth for a low-latency microphone-based interface.</p><p> The case slides open just enough to accommodate an iPad and, once closed, wraps around both ends of the tablet without interfering with any of the cameras, buttons, or the 30-pin / <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Lightning/">Lightning</a> port. Audojo automatically connects to the iPad via the standard 3.5mm audio jack, which is replicated at the bottom of the case next to a power switch, LED and mini-USB connector (for charging). It's important to note that the accessory is not designed to charge the iPad, something that would require a larger battery and increase complexity / cost. We spent some time with a prototype iPad gaming case and came away pretty satisfied -- head past the break for our impressions. </p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/audojo-ipad-gaming-case-hands-on/">Audojo iPad gaming case hands-on</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/audojo-ipad-gaming-case-hands-on/5587767"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/audojoipadgamingcase01_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/audojo-ipad-gaming-case-hands-on/5587768"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/audojoipadgamingcase02_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/audojo-ipad-gaming-case-hands-on/5587769"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/audojoipadgamingcase03_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/audojo-ipad-gaming-case-hands-on/5587770"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/audojoipadgamingcase04_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/audojo-ipad-gaming-case-hands-on/5587771"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/audojoipadgamingcase05_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><p> </p><p> At first sight, Audojo's prototype looks a little clunky since it adds quite a bit of girth to the iPad's figure. Once you pick it up, however, that's all quickly forgotten -- it's light and well balanced and feels comfortable in hand. The analog joysticks and shoulder buttons are in just the right place -- if you're used to playing console games, you'll be right at home. If there's any room for improvement, it's with the pods that house the shoulder buttons, electronics and batteries at the back of the case. These are currently too wide but Audojo plans to remedy this before production thanks to an improved circuit board layout. We were impressed with the prototype's build quality (it's CNC machined), especially the design of sliding mechanism used to capture the iPad. Production units are slated to be thinner, with flush <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/PSP/">PSP</a>-like analog joysticks and two headphone jacks (instead of one). Battery life currently beats the iPad when blasting the built-in speakers, and stretches to several weeks (!) when listening with headphones.</p><p> Audojo currently integrates with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Unity/">Unity</a> (with a package available in the Unity Asset Store) and provides a native Objective C SDK. The company is very interested in connecting with developers and is offering special packages ($600 and up) that include prototypes as part of its Kickstarter campaign. A few games already support the iPad gaming case, including <em>1948: Dawn of Future</em> and <em>Cowboy Guns</em> (both available in the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/AppStore/">App Store</a>) plus the Unity demo <em>Angry Bots</em> and the unofficial iOS port of <em>Quake III</em>. The accessory is expected to ship in July 2013 and retail for $99, but Audojo is making it available today on Kickstarter for $55 (first 200 backers) and up.

With today's announcement, Amazon now provides In-App Purchasing services for Mac, PC and Web, Android and Kindle Fire developers, enabling them to offer Amazon's millions of customers a convenient, trusted and secure buying experience. To get started developers can visit: http://developer.amazon.com/games/in-app-purchasing.</p>  <p>   Benefits for developers with Amazon's new In-App Purchasing for Mac, PC and Web-based games include:</p>  <p>   Customers can use any credit card, gift certificate or promotional credit associated with their current Amazon account to purchase in-app items-making it simple and low friction for customers to purchase content and leading to higher sales and increased conversion.<br>   Developers automatically have access to Amazon's proven fraud detection technology, thereby reducing their exposure to fraud.<br>   All transactions are supported by Amazon's world-class, top-rated Customer Service to provide customers with the very best purchasing experience.</p>  <p>   To help developers with game discovery and marketing, in-app items will automatically be available on Amazon.com, and in-app purchases can show up on best seller lists, recommendations and merchandising campaigns, helping customers discover new games and items, while adding another point of engagement for existing players.</p>  <p>   "We're passionate about making game developers successful, and we'll continue to build services that make monetization easier and remove undifferentiated heavy lifting from developers," said Mike Frazzini, Director Amazon Games. "Game developers build games that are used across multiple platforms and mediums. In-App Purchasing for Mac, PC and Web-based games is our latest service that helps game developers grow their business and increase their customer-base. For years, Amazon has focused on making the online shopping experience as frictionless as possible, and we are excited to share this expertise and technology so that game developers can offer customers this same great experience."</p>  <p>   In-App Purchasing for Mac, PC and Web-based games is a part of a larger family of end-to-end services for game developers. From Amazon Web Services (AWS) building blocks like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Dynamo DB used for backend infrastructure, to services like Game Circle (which includes capabilities like Achievements, Leaderboards, Friends, and Whispersync for Games across devices) that enable developers to create more engaging gaming experiences, to services like A/B Testing and Game Connect (which lets developers marry the ease and security of shopping on Amazon with the convenience of having virtual goods delivered directly to customers' game accounts), to providing distribution to millions of Amazon customers via the Amazon Appstore for Android and the Digital Games Store on Amazon.com, Amazon provides the most complete platform for game developers.</p>  <p>   "We were excited to work with Amazon on integrating In-App Purchasing into Forsaken Planet," said David Sterling, Vice President of Sony DADC's LOOT Entertainment. "Giving gamers the option to buy in-game goods using their Amazon account makes it easier for them to get what they want without ever having to leave the game environment."</p>  <p>   "We love that Amazon will allow players of FreeFall Tournament to buy virtual items using the same login credentials and payment information they already have on file with Amazon.com. We think it will help minimize buying friction," said Chris Scholz, CEO of Free Range Games. "We also feel good knowing Amazon is very trusted and secure, and we think it will give our players the same degree of confidence that they have when purchasing any other item on Amazon.com."</p>  <p>   "When we discovered that Amazon was offering In-App Purchasing for PC, Mac and Web-based games, we were eager to participate. Amazon has worked closely with our publishing platform team and gone the extra mile to make sure our implementation will be fast and easy for our upcoming action-RPG game KingsRoad," said Mark Spenner, GM, Rumble Entertainment. "Amazon's In-App Purchasing creates an opportunity for increased discoverability, and we are excited that our in-game items will be offered to the very large Amazon customer base."</p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/" rel="tag">Gaming</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/software/" rel="tag">Software</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/amazon/" rel="tag">Amazon</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/amazon-in-app-purchasing-mac-pc-web/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://gameservices.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/inapppurchasing.html">Amazon</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"a7b811be63cb995df36783694219b35d";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:69:"ITV Drama Executives Behind 'Downton Abbey' to Launch Production Firm";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/eyUK3cVSSv0/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:12:"Georg Szalai";s:4:"date";i:1358868278;s:7:"content";s:2643:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2013/01/shirley_maclaine_downton_abbey_a_l.jpg"><br>UPDATED: Laura Mackey, the British TV company's director of drama, and controller of drama commissioning Sally Haynes will depart mid-year.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/itv-drama-executives-depart-downton-414244" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27c8502d/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=ITV+Drama+Executives+Behind+%27Downton+Abbey%27+to+Launch+Production+Firm&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fitv-drama-executives-depart-downton-414244" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=ITV+Drama+Executives+Behind+%27Downton+Abbey%27+to+Launch+Production+Firm&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fitv-drama-executives-depart-downton-414244" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

The camera maker is hoping to spark some new life this month with the relaunch of its photo cloud as Nikon Image Space. Thankfully, it's a lot more than a more elegant title, as Nikon is promising a simpler interface as well as tighter integration with social networks like Facebook and Twitter. All access is free, although the level of service depends on loyalty: just 2GB of space is available to anyone, while those who want a more tightly controlled 20GB account will need to prove they own a Nikon camera. Photographers willing to give the reborn service a chance will have to wait until the Image Space launch on January 28th, but those already onside with MyPicturetown will have their photos transferred for free.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cameras/" rel="tag">Cameras</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/storage/" rel="tag">Storage</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/" rel="tag">Internet</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/nikon/" rel="tag">Nikon</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/nikon-rebrands-its-cloud-photo-storage-as-image-space/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/2013/01/nikon-image-space-online-image-sharing-service-announced/" target="_blank">Ubergizmo</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.nikon.com/news/2013/0122_imagespace_01.htm" target="_blank">Nikon</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"a2fa945cf625b64d966c975132f5f5d1";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:60:"Get a Seagate Backup Plus 1TB portable hard drive for $79.99";s:4:"link";s:56:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~3/n5yFiFrDQsQ/";s:6:"author";s:11:"Rick Broida";s:4:"date";i:1358866337;s:7:"content";s:834:"That's your out-the-door, no-rebate price on this USB 3.0 drive, which features a super-slim design and built-in backup software. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13845_3-57565118-58/get-a-seagate-backup-plus-1tb-portable-hard-drive-for-%2479.99/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=readMore">[Read more]</a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://cnet.com.feedsportal.com/c/34938/f/645093/s/27c7e11a/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884780302/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c7e11a/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884780302/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c7e11a/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884780302/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c7e11a/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~4/n5yFiFrDQsQ" height="1" width="1">";s:9:"feed_link";s:21:"http://news.cnet.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:9:"CNET News";}s:32:"915b4e5022e338d99c4d2660a7c45a24";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:41:"12 Months of Xbox Live Gold Are $35 Today";s:4:"link";s:95:"http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/IgevI4I2ZDw/12-months-of-xbox-live-gold-are-35-today";s:6:"author";s:11:"Kyle Wagner";s:4:"date";i:1358865940;s:7:"content";s:2260:"<div> <!-- div style="background-color: #B3B3B3; width: 190px; padding: 1px;"><a title="Click here to read 12 Months of Xbox Live Gold Are $35 Today" href="http://gizmodo.com/dealzmodo/" style="background-color:#888888; color:#FFFFFF; font-size:12px;text-align:right; display:block; height:14px; padding:1px 2px; text-decoration:none; text-transform:uppercase; width:156px;"><span style="color: white;" class="hash">#</span><span style="color: white;">dealzmodo</span></a></div --> <div><a title="Click here to read 12 Months of Xbox Live Gold Are $35 Today" href="http://gizmodo.com/5977945/12-months-of-xbox-live-gold-are-35-today"> <img height="360" width="640" title="Click here to read 12 Months of Xbox Live Gold Are $35 Today" alt="Click here to read 12 Months of Xbox Live Gold Are $35 Today" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18cadi8agsb0cjpg/xlarge.jpg"></a></div> </div> Xbox Live isn't perrrrfect&mdash;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5915635/its-time-for-xbox-live-gold-to-be-free">we wish the streaming half weren't still paywalled</a>&mdash;but for a lot of us, it's how we game and stream and basically use our TVs in any way at all.

Pending an FCC review, of course. This morning the former Ma Bell announced that it would be purchasing the American assets of Atlantic Tele-Network, which uses the Alltel brand here in the US, for $780 million. While the additional customer revenue will surely be welcome, it's clear that AT&amp;T is primarily after the spectrum here, which it calls "largely complimentary" to its current holdings. The smaller carrier is particularly popular in the rural areas of Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina -- places that the nation's second largest mobile network could use a boost in.</p><p> Besides regulatory approval, which shouldn't prove to be a major obstacle, the company also faces challenges integrating Alltel's existing infrastructure with its own. Currently the smaller carrier operates a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/31/verizon-may-cut-whats-left-of-alltel-data-starting-january-10th/">CDMA network</a> on its frequency bands, which must be retooled to work with AT&amp;T's GSM, HSPA and LTE technologies. Customers will also need to be migrated from their current handsets to AT&amp;T compatible ones. So, while rural customers could see a significant improvement in coverage, we wouldn't expect the deal to bear fruit immediately.

(ATNI) to acquire the company's U.S. retail wireless operations, operated under the Alltel brand, for $780 million in cash. Under terms of the agreement, AT&amp;T will acquire wireless properties, including licenses, network assets, retail stores and approximately 585,000 subscribers.</p>  <p>   ATNI operates under the Alltel name in the U.S., and its network covers approximately 4.6 million people in primarily rural areas across six states - Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina. The acquisition includes spectrum in the 700 MHz, 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands and is largely complementary to AT&amp;T's existing network. ATNI currently operates a retail CDMA network for its subscribers in these areas. AT&amp;T expects that as it upgrades the network, ATNI customers and existing AT&amp;T customers who roam in these areas will enjoy an enhanced mobile Internet experience.</p>  <p>   AT&amp;T expects integration costs for network conversion from CDMA will not result in significant dilution to EPS or impact to cash flow. The transaction is subject to review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice and to other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2013.</p>  <p>   *AT&amp;T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&amp;T Inc. under the AT&amp;T brand and not by AT&amp;T Inc.</p>  <p>   About AT&amp;T</p>  <p>   AT&amp;T Inc.

If you only needed fewer risks than before, though, the downloads and details await at the source links.<br><br> [Thanks, Rashid]</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/samsung/" rel="tag">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/google/" rel="tag">Google</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/cyanogenmod-10-1-milestone/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href="http://donandroid.com/cm10-1-m1-for-galaxy-s3-nexus-4-7-10-captivate-tab-2-724" target="_blank">DonAndroid</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://get.cm/?type=snapshot" target="_blank">CyanogenMod (1)</a><!--//-->, <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cm-10-1-m-series-builds-have-arrived" target="_blank">(2)</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"eb3e2a7c8820faf4ae9f1187f08af32e";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:60:"iPhone wins 51 percent of U.S. smartphone sales, says report";s:4:"link";s:56:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~3/SyWueOqh_1Y/";s:6:"author";s:13:"Lance Whitney";s:4:"date";i:1358861836;s:7:"content";s:848:"Apple snared more than 50 percent of U.S. smartphone sales last quarter, says Kantar, though Android remained dominant across Europe and the world. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57565106-37/iphone-wins-51-percent-of-u.s-smartphone-sales-says-report/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=readMore">[Read more]</a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://cnet.com.feedsportal.com/c/34938/f/645093/s/27c71dc9/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884691851/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c71dc9/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884691851/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c71dc9/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884691851/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c71dc9/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~4/SyWueOqh_1Y" height="1" width="1">";s:9:"feed_link";s:21:"http://news.cnet.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:9:"CNET News";}s:32:"d7ecac3fe5aa120a52457d29f27a0f14";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:40:"Mozilla devs working on Firefox for OUYA";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/mozilla-firefox-for-ouya/";s:6:"author";s:10:"Nicole Lee";s:4:"date";i:1358860440;s:7:"content";s:2257:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/mozilla-firefox-for-ouya/"><img alt="DNP Mozilla devs working to get Firefox on the OUYA" data-src-height="465" data-src-width="620" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/firefoxouya.jpg"></a></p><p> Sure the <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/ouya">OUYA</a> may have captured the imagination of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/ouya-and-kill-screen-announce-create-game-jam/">indie game developers</a> everywhere, but open-source fans will be glad to know it's sparked the interest of Mozilla's <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/firefox">Firefox</a> team as well. According to an <em>OUYAForum</em> post by administrator Ed Krassenstein, a Mozilla developer had sent him a note detailing the process of bringing the popular browser to the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/09/ouyas-kickstarter-funding-is-complete-over-8-5-million-raised/">Kickstarter-funded gaming console</a>. The team apparently managed to get it running after some preliminary patches, but it still has a ways to go -- WebGL, Canvas and relevant API support are still lacking. The dev in question has since been identified as mobile platform engineer Chris Lord, who tweeted the revealing picture above along with the note that it's "kinda unusable" for now. Still, they do have around <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/09/ouya-console-pre-order/">three months before the console ships</a>, which could be enough for them to perfect an OUYA version of the foxy browser just in time for launch day.</p><p> [Image credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/cwiiis/status/293390930009026560/photo/1">Chris Lord</a>, Twitter]</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/" rel="tag">Gaming</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/mozilla-firefox-for-ouya/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Via:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/mozilla-devs-are-working-to-optimize-firefox-for-the-ouya-android-game-console/">TechCrunch</a><!--//--></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://ouyaforum.com/showthread.php?1122-Mozilla-is-working-to-bring-Firefox-to-OUYA!&amp;p=6901">OUYAforum</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"142281e0a3cff7a4885b1c8fccdfe20c";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:59:"Verizon's FiOS TV Subscriber Growth Slows in Fourth Quarter";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thr/news/~3/4x9ZQ9gkz7k/story01.htm";s:6:"author";s:12:"Georg Szalai";s:4:"date";i:1358859217;s:7:"content";s:2568:"<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2011/10/37207verizonlogoprhr_a_l.jpg"><br>The telecom giant signed up 134,000 new pay TV subscribers, down from 194,000 in the year-ago period.<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fios-tv-fourth-quarter-subscribers-414237" target="_blank">read more</a></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/34793/f/641578/s/27c70300/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Verizon%27s+FiOS+TV+Subscriber+Growth+Slows+in+Fourth+Quarter&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Ffios-tv-fourth-quarter-subscribers-414237" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Verizon%27s+FiOS+TV+Subscriber+Growth+Slows+in+Fourth+Quarter&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Ffios-tv-fourth-quarter-subscribers-414237" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><div>

Those 2.1 million new additions mean that Verizon can now lay claim to 98.2 million customers in total, while smartphones have now claimed an additional 5 percent of this base, up to 58 percent. Since its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/18/verizon-q3-2012-financials/">last report</a>, <span>Q4 consolidated revenues totaled $30 billion for the first time, although profits were hit by $135 million in damages from Hurricane Sandy as well as a one-time pension cost that meant the company took a charge of between $9 and 10 billion for the quarter. This made up a $1.93 billion loss for the carrier, which remained, unsurprisingly, upbeat. </span><span>According to Verizon, its LTE network is now available to 273 million people and CEO Lowell McAdam is calling the last twelve months "a year of solid progress."</span></p><div> <div>  Show full PR text</div> <div>  <p>   <strong>Earnings Impacted by Previously Announced Non-Operational Charges</strong></p>  <p>   4Q 2012 HIGHLIGHTS<br>   Wireless</p>  <p>   8.5 percent year-over-year increase in service revenues in 4Q 2012; 8.4 percent year-over-year increase in retail service revenues.<br>   2.2 million retail net additions, excluding acquisitions and adjustments, including a record-high 2.1 million retail postpaid net connections; low retail postpaid churn of 0.95 percent; 98.2 million total retail connections, 92.5 million total retail postpaid connections.<br>   4G LTE service now available to more than 273 million people in 476 markets across the U.S.<br>   Wireline</p>  <p>   4.1 percent year-over-year increase in consumer revenues; consumer ARPU (average revenue per user) up 9.5 percent year over year, to $105.63.<br>   144,000 FiOS Internet and 134,000 FiOS Video net additions, with continued increased sales penetration for both services; 5.4 million total FiOS Internet, 4.7 million total FiOS Video customers.<br>   Consolidated Earnings</p>  <p>   A loss of $1.48 in earnings per share (EPS), compared with a loss of 71 cents per share in 4Q 2011, impacted by non-cash pension items in both quarters and additional non-operational debt retirement and other restructuring items in 4Q 2012.<br>   A 7-cent-per-share impact due to Superstorm Sandy yielded 38 cents per share in adjusted EPS (non-GAAP), compared with 52 cents in adjusted EPS in 4Q 2011.<br>   NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today reported strong customer and revenue growth in Verizon Wireless and Verizon FiOS services in fourth-quarter 2012 -- positioning the company well for 2013.</p>  <p>   Verizon Wireless reported record-setting customer additions in the quarter, while Verizon FiOS customer additions were higher in fourth-quarter 2012 than in the prior two quarters, despite the impact of Superstorm Sandy.</p>  <p>   "Verizon seized growth opportunities in the fourth quarter to cap a year of solid progress across the entire business," said Lowell McAdam, Verizon chairman and CEO. "We delivered a total return of 13.2 percent to shareholders in 2012, and we enter 2013 ready to accelerate the momentum we've achieved and create significant shareholder value in the years to come."</p>  <p>   4Q and Full-Year Earnings Results</p>  <p>   Due to the impact of non-operational items announced earlier this month, Verizon reported a loss of $1.48 in EPS in fourth-quarter 2012, compared with a fourth-quarter 2011 loss of 71 cents per share.</p>  <p>   A reduction of 7 cents per share due to impacts from Superstorm Sandy yielded a total of 38 cents per share in adjusted fourth-quarter 2012 earnings (non-GAAP). Fourth-quarter 2012 charges totaled $1.86 per share: $1.55 per share related to severance, pension and benefit charges primarily for the annual actuarial valuation of Verizon's benefit plans as well as the annuitization of various pension liabilities during the quarter, and 31 cents per share related to the early retirement of debt and other restructuring activities.</p>  <p>   Comparable adjusted fourth-quarter 2011 earnings of 52 cents per share excluded charges of $1.23 per share, primarily related to the valuation of pension plans.</p>  <p>   On an annual basis, Verizon reported 31 cents in 2012 EPS, compared with 85 cents per share in 2011. Adjusted annual EPS (non-GAAP) was $2.24 in 2012, compared with $2.15 in 2011.</p>  <p>   Revenue Growth Across All Strategic Areas; Continued Strong Cash Flow</p>  <p>   In fourth-quarter 2012, Verizon's consolidated quarterly operating revenues exceeded $30.0 billion for the first time in company history. This represented a 5.7 percent increase compared with fourth-quarter 2011 and was the company's highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2012.</p>  <p>   For full-year 2012, Verizon's revenues totaled $115.8 billion, an increase of 4.5 percent, or $5.0 billion, compared with 2011. In fourth-quarter 2012, Verizon saw year-over-year revenue increases across all strategic growth areas: 8.5 percent for Verizon Wireless service revenues, 15.7 percent for FiOS revenues and 5.3 percent for strategic enterprise services.</p>  <p>   Cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.5 billion in 2012, an increase of 5.7 percent compared with $29.8 billion in 2011.</p>  <p>   Capital expenditures were $16.2 billion in 2012, including $135 million in companywide capital related to Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts, and totaled about $70 million less than in 2011. Free cash flow (non-GAAP, cash flow from operations less capex) was $15.3 billion for the year, an increase of 13.1 percent compared with $13.5 billion in 2011.</p>  <p>   Verizon maintained a strong balance sheet, with year-end 2012 total debt of $52.0 billion, down from $55.2 billion at year-end 2011.</p>  <p>   Verizon Wireless Delivers Record-High Customer Additions and Strong Revenue Growth</p>  <p>   In fourth-quarter 2012, Verizon Wireless delivered the highest number of retail postpaid net additions of any quarter in its history, strong growth in revenues, an increase in smartphone penetration, and continued low retail postpaid churn.</p>  <p>   Wireless Financial Highlights</p>  <p>   Total revenues were $20.0 billion in fourth-quarter 2012, up 9.5 percent year over year. Service revenues in the quarter totaled $16.4 billion, up 8.5 percent year over year. Retail service revenues grew 8.4 percent year over year, to $15.8 billion.<br>   For full-year 2012, total revenues were $75.9 billion, up 8.1 percent over full-year 2011, and service revenues were $63.7 billion in 2012, up 7.7 percent year over year.<br>   Retail postpaid ARPA (average revenue per account) grew 6.6 percent over fourth-quarter 2011, to $146.80 per month. As customers continue to add multiple devices to accounts following the introduction of the Share Everything Plan in June, Verizon Wireless now reports ARPA instead of ARPU since customers can share data among multiple devices.<br>   In fourth-quarter 2012, wireless operating income margin was 24.0 percent and segment EBITDA margin on service revenues (non-GAAP) was 41.4 percent, down 80 basis points from fourth-quarter 2011. For full-year 2012, operating income margin was 28.7 percent, up 230 basis points from full-year 2011; segment EBITDA margin was 46.6 percent, up 180 basis points year over year.<br>   Wireless Operational Highlights</p>  <p>   Verizon Wireless added 2.2 million net retail connections in the fourth quarter, including a record-high 2.1 million retail postpaid net connections. The company added 5.0 million net retail postpaid connections in 2012, the most in four years. These additions exclude acquisitions and adjustments.<br>   At the end of 2012, the company had 98.2 million retail connections, a 6.6 percent increase year over year -- including 92.5 million retail postpaid connections.<br>   Verizon Wireless had 35.1 million retail postpaid accounts at the end of the fourth quarter, a 1.4 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2011, and an average of 2.6 connections per account, up 4.3 percent year over year.<br>   At year-end 2012, smartphones accounted for more than 58 percent of the Verizon Wireless retail postpaid customer phone base, up from 53 percent at the end of third-quarter 2012.<br>   Retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in the fourth quarter and retail churn was 1.24 percent, both up 1 basis point year over year.<br>   Verizon Wireless continued to roll out its 4G LTE mobile broadband network, the largest 4G LTE network in the U.S. As of today (Jan. 22), Verizon Wireless 4G LTE service is available to more than 273 million people -- close to 89 percent of the population -- in 476 markets across the U.S.<br>   The company continued to enhance its device lineup with new smartphones and tablets. In the fourth quarter, Verizon Wireless launched eight 4G LTE smartphones: the DROID RAZR HD and DROID RAZR MAXX HD by Motorola; Windows Phone 8X by HTC; Nokia Lumia 822; Samsung Galaxy Note II; Spectrum 2 by LG; Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II; and the DROID DNA by HTC. In addition, Verizon Wireless launched three tablets in the quarter: the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, Apple iPad with Retina display and Apple iPad mini.<br>   Verizon Wireless announced it will begin offering shared data plans for business on Jan. 24, 2013, with the Share Everything Plan for Small Business and the Nationwide for Business Data Packages and Plans.<br>   Wireline Reports Continued Strong FiOS Customer and Revenue Growth</p>  <p>   In the Wireline segment, FiOS customer growth in fourth-quarter 2012 was greater than in the prior two quarters, despite the disruption caused by Superstorm Sandy. In global enterprise and wholesale, increased sales of strategic services continued to help mitigate lower revenues resulting from secular and global economic impacts.</p>  <p>   Wireline Financial Highlights</p>  <p>   Fourth-quarter 2012 operating revenues were $10.0 billion, a decline of 1.5 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2011. Consumer revenues grew 4.1 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2011. On an annual basis, 2012 consumer revenues totaled $14.0 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent compared with 2011 and Verizon's highest annual revenue growth rate in consumer wireline in 10 years.<br>   Consumer ARPU for wireline services increased to $105.63 in fourth-quarter 2012, up 9.5 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2011.<br>   ARPU for FiOS customers continues to be more than $150. FiOS services produced about 68 percent of consumer wireline revenues in fourth-quarter 2012. About two-thirds of FiOS consumer customers have purchased a "triple play" of phone, Internet and video services.<br>   Global enterprise revenues totaled $3.8 billion in the quarter, down 2.1 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2011. Sales of strategic services increased 5.3 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2011 and represented 54 percent of global enterprise revenues. Strategic services include Verizon Terremark cloud and data center services, security and IT solutions, advanced communications, and strategic networking.<br>   For 2012, wireline operating income margin was 0.2 percent and wireline EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 21.3 percent, including the negative impact of fourth-quarter storm recovery. Excluding identifiable storm impacts (non-GAAP), wireline operating income margin was 1.0 percent and wireline EBITDA margin was 22.1 percent.<br>   Wireline Operational Highlights</p>  <p>   Verizon added 144,000 net new FiOS Internet connections and 134,000 net new FiOS Video connections in fourth-quarter 2012. Verizon had a total of 5.4 million FiOS Internet and 4.7 million FiOS Video connections at the end of the quarter, representing year-over-year increases of 12.6 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively.<br>   FiOS penetration (subscribers as a percentage of potential subscribers) continued to increase. FiOS Internet penetration was 37.3 percent at the end of fourth-quarter 2012, compared with 35.5 percent at the end of fourth-quarter 2011. In the same periods, FiOS Video penetration was 33.3 percent, compared with 31.5 percent. The FiOS network passed 17.6 million premises at year-end 2012.<br>   Broadband connections totaled 8.8 million at year-end 2012, a 1.4 percent year-over-year increase. Revenues from broadband connections grew 3.1 percent -- to $3.5 billion for full-year 2012 -- over the same period, driven by customer purchases of higher-speed FiOS services.<br>   Verizon has been replacing high-maintenance portions of its residential copper network with fiber optics to provide enhanced services and to reduce ongoing repair costs. In 2012, Verizon migrated 223,000 homes to fiber, which contributed to an 11 percent improvement in trouble reports across Verizon's entire copper network for the year. The company has a target of 300,000 additional migrations within FiOS markets in 2013.<br>   To meet rapidly growing customer-traffic demands, Verizon deployed additional 100G (gigabits per second) technology on network routes in the U.S. and Europe in fourth-quarter 2012. In the U.S., these high-capacity routes included Atlanta to Tampa, Kansas City to Dallas and Salt Lake City to Seattle. During 2012, the company added 13,000 miles to its 100G network in the U.S.<br>   Verizon Enterprise Solutions completed agreements with multinational and U.S. corporations The Coca-Cola Company, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., Bridgestone Americas, CME Group, Redbox and Shred-It for advanced business technology solutions.<br>   Verizon Enterprise Solutions launched a comprehensive cloud and data center infrastructure portfolio specifically designed to help the health care industry meet the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements for safeguarding electronic protected health information.</p> </div></div><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/verizon/" rel="tag">Verizon</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/verizon-q4-2012-financials/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www22.verizon.com/investor/app_resources/htmls/news_verizon_reports_strong_revenue_and_customer_growth_for_verizon_wireless_and_fios_services_in_4q_2012.htm">Verizon</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"b8191b93ac3bcbeec2c6ccfc6efc6b95";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:51:"GeeksPhone reveals Firefox OS phones for developers";s:4:"link";s:56:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~3/uycdaMCa9W8/";s:6:"author";s:17:"Stephen Shankland";s:4:"date";i:1358855307;s:7:"content";s:855:"Mainstream customers need not apply, but programmers who like the openness of Mozilla's browser-based Firefox OS will soon get a chance to help make it a reality. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57565086-94/geeksphone-reveals-firefox-os-phones-for-developers/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=readMore">[Read more]</a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://cnet.com.feedsportal.com/c/34938/f/645093/s/27c699f8/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884772865/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c699f8/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884772865/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c699f8/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884772865/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c699f8/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~4/uycdaMCa9W8" height="1" width="1">";s:9:"feed_link";s:21:"http://news.cnet.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:9:"CNET News";}s:32:"e61a5bf3c3e24fd12ca48157161c963f";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:55:"Verizon Q4 loss doubles, pushed by Sandy, pension costs";s:4:"link";s:56:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~3/kTMsYsuBJlA/";s:6:"author";s:11:"Roger Cheng";s:4:"date";i:1358855304;s:7:"content";s:812:"The telecommunications provider saw revenue rise nearly 6 percent on strong customer growth in the wireless business. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57564808-94/verizon-q4-loss-doubles-pushed-by-sandy-pension-costs/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=readMore">[Read more]</a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://cnet.com.feedsportal.com/c/34938/f/645093/s/27c699fc/mf.gif" border="0"><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884772863/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c699fc/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884772863/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c699fc/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884772863/u/49/f/645093/c/34938/s/27c699fc/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~4/kTMsYsuBJlA" height="1" width="1">";s:9:"feed_link";s:21:"http://news.cnet.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:9:"CNET News";}s:32:"8ae9a014ca3da9afe28e6f2e18381bc9";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:69:"Report: Xbox 720 Will Pack an 8-Core AMD Chip, 1.2 Teraflops of Power";s:4:"link";s:121:"http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/gizmodo/full/~3/Wvh7a1XyIV0/report-xbox-720-will-pack-an-8+core-amd-chip-12-teraflops-of-power";s:6:"author";s:22:"Sam Gibbs - Gizmodo UK";s:4:"date";i:1358855220;s:7:"content";s:2102:"<div> <!-- div style="background-color: #B3B3B3;

It's not quite the same as the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/firefox-os-mystery-phone/">mystery device</a> we saw sporting Firefox OS at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/ces2013">CES</a>, but its specs seem almost as basic. The handset will feature a 3.5-inch HVGA touchscreen and 3-megapixel camera on the outside, with a 1GHz Snapdragon S1 CPU, half a gig of RAM, 4GB of microSD-expandable storage and WiFi, 2G and 3G antennae inside. Sure, that processor isn't a beast, but an 800MHz S1 does just fine in the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/13/nokia-lumia-610-review/">Lumia 610</a>. <span>A 1580mAh battery will keep the carrier-unlocked phone running, and Mozilla is promising OTA updates to Firefox OS to keep devs, well, up to date. At the moment, we have no idea how much the phone will cost, but the first units are expected to be available next month.</span></p><p> The developer handset is called the Keon, according to creator <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/geeksphone">Geekphone's</a> website, and while not mentioned in the Mozilla Hacks blog post, it appears to have a more powerful cousin called the Peak. It's got a 4.3-inch qHD screen, 8-megapixel back-facing camera (with flash) and 2-megapixel shooter round the front. A 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 CPU and larger 1800mAh battery are within, but storage, RAM and connectivity specs are the same as the smaller Keon. Mozilla may not be formally promoting this as its own dev handset, but it was still included in the picture which accompanied the announcement (see above: the Keon is in orange, the Peak in white). We're getting in contact with Mozilla to clarify, and will update you when we hear back.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/firefox-os-developer-phone/#comments">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/announcing-the-firefox-os-developer-preview-phone/">Mozilla</a><!--//-->, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geeksphone.com/">Geeksphone</a><!--//--></p>";s:9:"feed_link";s:24:"http://www.engadget.com/";s:10:"feed_title";s:8:"Engadget";}s:32:"34da972e7fc9a19ffdd5749543b37324";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:74:"ASUS Vivo Tab Smart comes to the UK as the ME400, priced at £399 (update)";s:4:"link";s:68:"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/asus-vivotab-me400-uk-399-pounds/";s:6:"author";s:9:"Mat Smith";s:4:"date";i:1358853720;s:7:"content";s:4555:"<p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/22/asus-vivotab-me400-uk-399-pounds/"><img alt="" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/01/asus-convertible-1-7-12-ces2013.jpg"></a></p><p> ASUS may have confused some of us with its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/29/asus-outs-dockable-windows-8-vivo-tab-and-vivo-tab-rt/">similar-sounding</a> Windows hardware range and it's showing no signs of stopping.

Intended to draw in even more native apps for its new mobile platform, the final cut-off date has now been moved from January 21st to February 18th. Talking to German paper, <em>Die Welt</em>, CEO <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/19/rim-ceo-thorsten-heins-interview/">Thorsten Heins</a> recently backed up <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/16/leaked-bb-10-sales-training-manual/">claims</a> that BlackBerry's new OS would launch with 70,000 apps, although we all know that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/14/bb10-twitter-and-google-talk-app-integration-leaks-ahead-of-laun/">quality</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/13/google-no-plans-to-develop-windows-8-windows-phone-apps/">trumps quantity</a> -- something that RIM aims to address. <span>If devs submit an app that makes over $1,000 but <em>less</em> than $10,000, the Waterloo phonemaker will fork out the difference -- app authors can also submit their programs for approval without charge.

In addition to the silicon, 8GB of built-in storage, 1GB of RAM and a microSD slot hide behind the 330 ppi display. As for optics, the phone carries a 1.3-megapixel front-facing cam and an 8-megapixel shooter accompanied by a dual-LED flash, and records 1080p footage. In terms of connectivity, the device features support for WiFi, Bluetooth and pulling down 21Mbps over HSDPA. Next month, the G 615 will be served up in Germany with Ice Cream Sandwich onboard, but Huawei says the hardware will be updated to Jelly Bean at some point in March. There's no word on a US release, but it's expected to hit the road for a few international markets in short order.
