## System Requirements

To run Microweber, you need the following components:

- HTTP server
- Database server
- PHP >= 8.2
    - `lib-xml` with DOM support
    - `GD` PHP extension
    - `intl` PHP extension
    - `curl` PHP extension
    - `json` PHP extension
    - `openssl` PHP extension
    - `sodium` PHP extension
    - `mbstring` PHP extension
    - `bcmath` PHP extension
    - `zip` PHP extension
    - `openssl` PHP extension
    - `bcmath` PHP extension
    - `fileinfo` PHP extension
    - `pdo_sqlite` PHP extension
    - `pdo_mysql` PHP extension

### PHP installation command

```bash
sudo apt install php8.2-{bcmath,bz2,curl,curl,dom,fileinfo,gd,intl,mbstring,mysql,opcache,sqlite3,xmlrpc,zip}
```


### HTTP Server

#### Apache

Ensure that the `mod_rewrite` module is enabled in your Apache configuration. Microweber automatically creates necessary `.htaccess` files during installation, including one with a `Deny All` directive in each folder to prevent unauthorized access to entry points other than `index.php`.

#### Nginx

For Nginx, add the following `location` directive to your server configuration block. The `root` directive should point to the base folder of your Microweber website (usually where this readme is located).

```nginx
server {
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
  }
  location ~ /(vendor|src|config|database|bootstrap|storage|app|routes|.git|.env) {
    deny all;
    return 404;
  }
}
```

### IIS

You can import the `.htaccess` rewrite rules for IIS. Ensure that the URL Rewrite module is enabled for your website.

### Database

Microweber supports multiple database engines, including MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. For small websites, SQLite is highly recommended. During installation, you can select from the databases enabled in your PHP configuration. If your preferred database server isn't listed, make sure to enable the corresponding PDO extension for your server in your PHP configuration.
