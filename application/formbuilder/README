The jquery.Formbuilder plugin is a script that allows you integrate
a jquery and php-based form-creation tool into your application.

The tool interface is constructed using form data presented in xml format
by the server. The php class assists you with storing the data,
generating the xml, generating the html form, and processing the data.
