When you start with the install you will need set admin account. This will be the only way to manage your website, blog or online shop. The fields you will need to fill are:

###MySQL hostname

This is the place where your Website database will be hosted. For example if you make installation on your personal computer the name will be (localhost), but if you already downloaded Microweber (MW) on your own server you must type (localhost) or the name of the database server host (ex. mysql.mywebsite.com).  


###MySQL username
On this field you must type the username you will use as a login for your database


###MySQL password
Type your password for the database user

###Database name

The name of your database. You must have prevoulsy created this database in the MySQL server.

###Table prefix

If you want to have multiple installations in one database you can set a custom table prefix. The name of this prefix it is up to you for example you can name it (site_1) or something else.



##Admin username

Here on this field you need to choose the username for your Microweber CMS. This name will be needed everytime when you want to login to manage your website or online shop. Good practice will be to escape the "admin" abbreviature but it is up to you. For example I use my name or the name of my cat.

##Admin email

Use real email for this. When you forgot your password you will need it!

##Admin Password

Please set strong and secure password. How strong is your password is equal to how much time will take someone break it and get your website.
