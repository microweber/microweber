Thanks to my wife Natali and my two sons, this all php-stuff and programming work for us already long time.
Hello Belarus, Grodno!

Giveaway to php community this stuf, so it will not be lost. Code itself is part of many working apps in e-commerce so it is tested. But as always it is as-is licence :)

If you have any propositions/questions/comments, post to icq:201821805

Good luck to you!
