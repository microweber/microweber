![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/.github/packages/og-package-preact.png)

## Installation

<TabsPackage name="@tabler/icons-preact" />

or just [download from Github](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/releases).

## How to use

It's build with ESmodules so it's completely tree-shakable. Each icon can be imported as a component.

```js
import { IconArrowDown } from '@tabler/icons-preact';

const App = () => {
  return <IconArrowDown />;
};

export default App;
```

You can pass additional props to adjust the icon.

```js
<IconArrowDown color="red" size={48} />
```

### Props

| `color`       | _String_ | currentColor |
