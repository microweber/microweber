Authorize.net Gateway Readme
============================

IMPORTANT:

1. Login into your authorize.net merchant account. Go to "Settings and Profile"
menu.

2. Go to "Payment Form->Form Fields" menu. At least uncheck all boxes near
"Customer ID". You can also disable another fields to make signup a bit less
painful for your customers.

3. Go to "MD5 Hash" menu. Set secret word to desired values and use that in
the "setUserInfo" function showed in the example.
