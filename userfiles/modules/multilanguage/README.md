! Important
 If you are not able to see the changes on the language that you add and select, this means simply

That there is no translation available for this language.

Here are the languages we support for now and they are available here:

So, guys, I you can see to work with Multilanguage in Microwber is easy as a child game.

You should know that, once installed the Multilanguage module will start upper on different

Other modules, which we think will be important for you also to be translatable and support Multilanguage.

A good example is the Contact Us form (or each other form)

If you have multilanguage installed and setup your contact form to send &quot;Auto-respond&quot; messages

Then you probably will want the user that will receive the auto respond to be on

The same language as when the form is submitted.

Here is a short video of 3 min – How to install and work with Multilanguage Module.
