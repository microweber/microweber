             THANKS - List of credits for GeSHi

I owe these people/groups my thanks for help with GeSHi. Thanks, guys!

- Amit Gupta            - Thanks for all that constructive criticism - it's
                          a great help for making GeSHi even better. And
                          thanks for the Wordpress plugin! (Anyone who is
                          interested in the plugin can visit:
                          http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/category/wp-plugins/igsyntax-hiliter/)

                          for all your criticisms and for that stylesheet-maker code :).

                          highlighting :D
