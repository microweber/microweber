  TODO for version 1.0.8

- Rewrite parse_code method and parse_non_string_part method to use build
  rather than replace method of highlighting. This should speed things up
  while making highlighting much "safer"
- Rework the load_from_file method and the one for getting a file extension,
  as documented in the source.
- Add option for "standards compliant" or "default" modes, where standards
  compliance generates the <pre> tags within the <li>s and non compliant mode
  does what happens currently.


  TODO for version 1.2.0

- Rewrite engine to use remove/replace method (will hopefully almost
  eliminate the need for regular expressions except for numbers/methods
  etc). This will also assist for making different output formats [DONE]
- "Intelligent" output format - eg if the user doesn't want lines to
  wrap and wants line numbers don't use <ol>, use the <table> method
  instead. (This saves on output)
- Clear split between "public" and "private" methods [DONE]
- PHP5 version
- "Themes" for styles - basically pre-made stylesheets that can be used
  to highlight code of any language in a similar manner [DONE]
- "Dialects" for languages - eg php4, php5. One master language definition
  file, and a bunch of "specialised" dialect files for each language
  Ability to specify a "specialised" dialect as default? [DONE]
- Look at load/memory usage and try to reduce
- Make tabs into tab-stops like a normal editor [DONE]
- Ability to add more than one multiline comment or string [DONE]
- Ability to specify that strings cannot be multiline [DONE]
- Create a "wrapper" class for ultra-easy use
- Code written in a style that conforms to a phpdoc utility [DONE, PEAR]
- Dig functions/methods out of code and where they are called make an internal
  link back to their definition


  TODO for version 2.0.0

- Support for multiple output formats (XHTML, XML, PDF, RTF etc) [DONE IN 1.2]
- Support for auto-indent/code "beautifing"
- Option for "Lite" highlighting - aims for speed and low server load
- "Intelligent" highlighting inside comments, and ability to highlight
  source in multiple languages at once (eg PHP+HTML) [DONE IN 1.2]
- Perhaps a script on the GeSHi site that would map urls to appropriate
  definitions and relocate the user? (eg, java documentation is
  structured in such a way that urls are not able to be used with GeSHi.
  Instead the URL could become:
  http://qbnz.com/highlighter/redirect.php?lang=java&kw=KeyWord
  and that script would redirect to the correct location.
  [BETTER FIX IN 1.2]
